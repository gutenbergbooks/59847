<span class="cheaderfont">THE VILLAINS’ PLOT.</span></h2>


<p>In fifteen minutes the emigrant train on the Union Pacific
railroad was to leave the depot at Omaha, going west.</p>

<p>Two men, evidently waiting for the train, might have been
seen pacing to and fro upon the station platform in close conversation.</p>

<p>The eldest of the two was apparently forty years of age.
He was of medium hight and build, with steel-gray eyes, sharp
and brilliant. His hair, which was cut closely to a well-shaped
head, was of a dark brown, as was also his heavy mustache
and whiskers. He was dressed in light gray clothes, after the
prevailing fashion of the day (1869).</p>

<p>The other individual was a man of some thirty years. He
was much taller than his companion, but not so compactly
built. His hair was black as the raven’s wing, and hung
about his shoulders long and straight. His eyes were black,
but small and evil-like. His face was smoothly shaven, and
bore the unmistakable evidence of a dissipated character. He
was dressed in a suit of dark clothes that fitted him stiffly and
made him appear ill at ease.</p>

<p>No one in Omaha knew these two individuals, yet their
names were spoken daily in connection with their crimes, for
the former was Duval Dungarvon, the notorious robber-captain
of the Black Hills, and the latter Blufe Brandon, the
renegade Cheyenne chief known as Black Bear.</p>

<p>Having glanced about them to see that no one was near,
the robber-chief asked, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“Well, Brandon, have you made up your mind about that
matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Not exactly,” added Brandon, “for, since I have considered
that you have oceans of gold stowed away in the ‘Hills,’
I think you can afford to say ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand furies!” replied the robber-captain; “what
would such a notorious cutthroat as you are do with <em>ten thousand
dollars</em>? You couldn’t spend it among your accursed Indians,
and you <em>dare</em> not attempt to spend it among white
people. But, however, I suppose I must submit, as the game
is in your own hands. But, mind you, the girl has got to be
placed in my hands at the Devil’s Tarn, forty miles south of
Cheyenne, and if one hair of her head is injured I will not give
you one cent!” and the eyes of the robber-captain glowed like
living coals of fire.</p>

<p>“How soon will Sanford&mdash;I believe that’s what you called
him&mdash;start for San Francisco?”</p>

<p>“Within the next ten days, I understand; however, I will
telegraph you at Julesburg on the morning they start, using,
of course, our hotel <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plumes</i>. Now remember.”</p>

<p>At this juncture the conductor’s call of, “All aboard”
ended the two villains’ conversation, and bidding his companion
adieu, Blufe Brandon entered the cars, and in another
moment he was rolling toward the mountains.</p>

<p>Duval Dungarvon entered an omnibus and ordered the
driver to drive him to the Wyoming hotel.</p>

<p>And thus in a few minutes two villains&mdash;one a robber and
the other a renegade&mdash;both from the fastnesses of the Black
Hills&mdash;had planned and plotted a dark and perhaps bloody
crime.</p>

<p>Five days later and Duval Dungarvon was again pacing the
depot-platform. He was alone, but, from the impatient look
upon his face and the occasional glance up the street, it was
evident that he was expecting some one.</p>

<p>Presently his face brightened as he saw a carriage, drawn
by four horses, rolling down toward the depot, and as it drove
up alongside the platform he walked to the opposite side and
mingled with some men collected there, but all the while
kept a close watch upon the carriage.</p>

<p>When the vehicle stopped, a tall, noble, gray-haired man of
some fifty years stepped out and assisted a young and beautiful
girl to the platform. These were followed by four young<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
men dressed in sportsmen’s garbs, each carrying a new Spencer
rifle and a game-bag.</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman was Colonel Wayland Sanford, and
the young girl his daughter Silvia. They were just about to
start on a visit to friends in San Francisco. Two of the
young men, Willis and Frank Armond, were the colonel’s
nephews and men of means and leisure. The other two,
Walter Lyman, attorney, and Ralph Rodman, physician and
surgeon, were Willis’ and Frank’s intimate friends, who, like
themselves, did not have to depend entirely upon their profession
for a livelihood; so the four young gentlemen had concluded
to accompany the colonel and daughter as far as the
mountains, where they could spend the summer in hunting as
recreation from the dust and heat of city life.</p>

<p>As soon as Duval Dungarvon saw the party enter the cars
that stood awaiting their load of human freight, he turned and
entered the telegraph office, and taking up a blank seated himself
at a desk and wrote the following message, which he at
once dispatched:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Omaha</span>, June 15th, 1869.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">William Bates</span>, Esqr., Julesburg, W. T.&mdash;Sanford and
daughter leave on morning train for San Francisco.</p>

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Clifton Payson.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Paying for the dispatch, the robber-captain went out upon
the platform. The cars were just rolling away, and from
one of the windows he beheld the eyes of Colonel Sanford
fixed upon him like one in a trance; but in an instant the
train was gone, and, turning on his heel, he strode away, muttering
to himself:</p>

<p>“By furies! he recognized me! It’s a good thing he’s
gone, Duval Dungarvon, <em>alias</em> Clifton Payson, for he might
have given you trouble, and the best thing for you is to get
out of here yourself.”</p>

<p>And so he did. The next day the villain took the train
west.</p>

<p>Had one from the grave confronted Colonel Sanford he
could not have been more startled than he was on seeing Duval
Dungarvon. For fully an hour he sat in profound silence,
which his young friends attributed to his feelings on leaving
home, and the possible idea that he might never live to return<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
to it again. Finally, however, he rallied and talked and
joked in his usual humorous spirits.</p>

<p>After nearly two days’ ride the train rolled into Julesburg,
where it stopped for a few minutes. But one person took
the train at this point, and that person was Blufe Brandon,
the renegade chief, his face completely disguised in a mass of
false, grizzly whiskers.</p>

<p>The renegade passed from coach to coach, and finally
seated himself on the seat behind Colonel Sanford, which happened
to be vacant. Julesburg was left far behind, and away
in the distance westward the dark range of the Black Hills
loomed up against the glowing sky.</p>

<p>There being no way-stations, the train rolled rapidly on,
never tiring, never halting, gliding into the dark cut, by roaring
cañon, over the yawning gorge, beneath the beetling crag,
through dismal tunnel&mdash;on, on until it had entered the environs
of the Black Hills. Then the evil-eyed passenger from
Julesburg glanced around, and, seeing no eye upon him,
placed his hand in his pocket and drew therefrom a small
packet which he at once tossed out at the window with considerable
force. A dull report like that of a pistol; a lurid
flash like that by a rocket, where the packet struck the earth,
followed this act. But one person in the cars saw that flash,
and that was he who produced it; but, far away up on a
mountain peak, another pair of eyes saw and read the meaning
of that flash, and immediately from the same hight a
blazing arrow shot far up into the air, described a beautiful
curve, and then fell to the earth again. Then, fully three
miles further on toward the west, from the summit of another
peak, a blue light might have been seen swinging to and fro,
then standing still, then rolling through the air like a blazing
hoop.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in rounding an abrupt curve, the glowing headlight
flashed on a red flag standing in the center of the track.
Instantly the wary engineer whistled down brakes, and in a
moment the train stopped. At that instant a yell that fairly
shook the old hills fell upon the ears of the passengers&mdash;a
savage, blood-curdling yell, mingled with the clash of firearms.</p>

<p>It required but a single thought for the passengers to realize<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
the terrible truth. <em>The train had been stopped by a band of
Indians!</em></p>

<p>Simultaneous with the yell of the Indians a loud, coarse
voice cried out:</p>

<p>“Put out the lights; the train has been attacked by the
Indians!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Blufe Brandon.</p>

<p>In an instant the lights were put out in that coach. Then
followed a confusion that beggars description. The yells of
the Indians, the report of pistols, the crashing of glass, the
jamming of shutters, the screaming of women, the commands
and shouts of men, made the moment awful, terrible.</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement Brandon sprung to his feet,
and, leaning forward, seized Silvia Sanford around the waist&mdash;lifted
her in his arms as though she had been an infant, and
turning, glided out the door and sprung from the car.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, help! Some one is carrying me off!” cried
Silvia, as she was borne from the car.</p>

<p>“Great God! what foul treachery is this?” cried Colonel
Sanford, springing to his feet. “Willis, Frank, boys, all come,
for Heaven’s sake!” and, followed by the four young men,
he rushed out and sprung from the car just in time to see the
villain disappear down a black defile with his child.</p>

<p>The moment the renegade sprung from the car every Indian
turned and followed him, leaving the train to resume its course,
which it did, leaving Colonel Sanford and his young friends
standing alone in that awful gloom!</p>

<p>It was quite evident that the attack had been carefully arranged,
simply for the abduction of Miss Sanford, for no one
was killed, nor did the savages attempt to board the train as
they had done on previous occasions; but withdrew at a signal
of their chief, Blufe Brandon.</p>

<p>A speechless silence fell over the colonel and his party.
They stood and gazed into the gloom that seemed impenetrable.</p>

<p>The prospect of recovering the lost girl appeared to the experienced
eyes of the father almost as gloomy as were the surroundings.</p>

<p>The remembrance of the face he had seen at Omaha as the
cars were leaving, the face of a man whom he knew to be his<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
bitter, implacable enemy, instantly caused him to connect the
man with the disappearance of his daughter.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was indeed fortunate that
the father was an experienced Indian-fighter. During the gold-fever
of 1848, he had crossed the plains twice, and spent many
years in the mines of California. Then during the Pike’s
Peak excitement he spent a couple of years there, and during
the late Indian troubles he had command of a regiment of
cavalry upon active duty, their field of operations being in
the immediate vicinity of the Black Hills. Thus most of his
life had been spent upon the frontier, or among the Indians,
whose language, haunts and habits he had learned to perfection;
and there was but little of the country in which they
now were but what he was intimately acquainted with, though
five years had elapsed since he had last traversed it. Knowing
that no time was to be lost he shaped their course, and at
once set off in the direction taken by the savages, the darkness
rendering it impossible to follow the trail.</p>

<p>Thus began the young men’s summer recreation on the
plains!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE AERIAL DEMON OF THE MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>


<p>Night had fallen, but through the darkness gleamed the
cheerful light of a camp-fire that burned in a little wooded
valley, near where it debouched from the Black Hills into the
great plain, or Buffalo Range. Within its radius of light, two
men were visible&mdash;one lying upon the ground asleep, the other
seated before the fire, evidently keeping guard. The former
was a short, heavy-set man, of some five and thirty years, with
a broad, florid face, that told of humor and good-nature. A
rifle was lying near, a hunting-knife was in his belt, and,
though sound asleep, his hand grasped a short, stout club or
<em>shillalah</em> which alone would have proclaimed his Hibernian
extraction.</p>

<p>The Irishman’s companion was a type of a different nationality.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
He was a tall, powerful negro, with skin black as the
ebon darkness around him. He possessed limbs and muscles
of Herculean development, and a face firm, courageous and
intellectual in its outlines. He held a double rifle, which
flashed like a bar of silver in the firelight. Both were dressed
in garbs of buck-skin, half-savage and half-civilized in fashion.</p>

<p>The negro sat with his rifle resting in the hollow of his
arm, gazing into the glowing fire with a kind of vacant look.</p>

<p>As the minutes stole by, his eyes grew heavy with watching,
and, presently, his head rolled languidly upon his shoulders
in a gentle doze. Soon, however, he was aroused by a sound&mdash;the
sound of approaching footsteps. He sprung to his feet,
and, shading his eyes with his hand, peered into the gloom.
At this moment five human figures emerged from the forest
and halted within the radius of light. It was Colonel Wayland
Sanford and his four young companions.</p>

<p>Colonel Sanford fixed his eyes upon those of the negro, and
for a moment the two stood glaring at each other with a look
of recognition, surprise, fear and revenge depicted upon their
features. A profound silence ensued. The hand of the darky
wandered mechanically to his knife, while the cold, gray eyes
of Sanford flashed like burning coals, and his breast heaved
and throbbed as though an internal volcano was surging
within it.</p>

<p>The colonel was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Ebony Jim! Villain and rascal!” he exclaimed, fiercely.
“Is it you?&mdash;you who deserve shooting without ceremony?”</p>

<p>The colonel’s words seemed to transform the negro. His
defiant, courageous look gave way to one of fear.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lor’!” he exclaimed, fairly trembling, “it’s ole
Massa Sanfor’, de poor young missus’ father, and now dis poor
nigger’s time am come!”</p>

<p>“Ah! you fear the halter of justice, do you, you black
wretch!” exclaimed the colonel, indignantly. “For four
years I have hunted you&mdash;to <em>shoot you</em>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, good Heaben, massa, I hab done nuffin’!”</p>

<p>“Then what brought you here, and why do you fear me?”</p>

<p>“’Cause, massa, I s’pose you and dem gemman dar come to
’rest dis nigger&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you ’members I war hid in de woods when poor
Massa Walraven war taken to de Debbil’s Tarn and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! for God’s sake, Ebony, speak not of that
affair!” cried the colonel, growing suddenly changed in his
tone toward the darky. He spoke so loud that the Irishman
was awakened from his slumber.</p>

<p>“Och, and be the Howly Vargin, and who’s this that comes
a disthurbing of me paceful shlumber at the dead hour av
night? Wirra, but I’ll sphring afoot and bate their heads
wid me ole shillalah, so I will, as me name is Flick O’Flynn,”
exclaimed the Hibernian, rising to a sitting posture and rubbing
his eyes confusedly.</p>

<p>“I am sorry we have disturbed you,” said Frank Armond,
apologetically, “but I hope you will pardon us for the unceremonious
intrusion.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and thet I will,” replied O’Flynn, gaining his equilibrium
of mind, “for it’s mees thet’s glad to say the likes
av yees in this h’athing conthry, so it is, so it is.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, Colonel Sanford had stepped to Ebony’s
side, and spoke in a lower and kinder voice:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Ebony, for my rashness; but tell me truthfully,
where is Florence Walraven?”</p>

<p>“Why should dis nigger know better dan enny body else,
massa?”</p>

<p>“Because I know you assisted her to flee from home four
years since, and now where is she?”</p>

<p>“Good Lor’ only knows. S’pecks she’s in heaben wid de
angels,” replied the negro, apparently much surprised.</p>

<p>“Come, Ebony!” exclaimed Sanford, growing nervous and
excited again. “Trifle not with me. You have lied to me
already; you know where Florence is; you assisted her to
flee. Speak, tell me the truth or your life shall pay&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good Lor’, you misjudge dis nigger, Massa Sanfor’. Nebber
sence poor Massa Walraven went into the army have I
see’d de young missus, and when Massa Walraven was convictioned
ob bein’ a traitor and taken to de Debbil’s Tarn&mdash;I
means when he war punished so orfully&mdash;dis nigger run
away into de mountain fear he be sarved so too, ’case he see’d
something, and nebber hab I see’d de young missus, nor nobody,
till dis blessed minit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“Are you speaking the truth, Ebony?” asked the colonel,
seriously, calmly.</p>

<p>“As I’s a born nigger dat’s de truf, Massa Sanfor’.”</p>

<p>“Then forgive me, old boy, for my hasty accusal,” said
the colonel, extending his hand to the darky. “Florence
has been missing for four years, and we always suspicioned
you of stealing her away.”</p>

<p>“Dis nigger cherishes nuffin ill in his heart to’rds ole
Massa Sanfor’,” said Ebony, grasping the colonel’s hand, “but
oh! how his heart aches when he t’inks ob dat awful&mdash;awful
’fair at the Debbil’s Tarn.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Ebony, about the Devil’s Tarn,” said Sanford in a
whisper. “It racks my soul with torture. Promise me you’ll
not mention it again.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said the negro.</p>

<p>“Then let us be seated and talk of other things.”</p>

<p>They all gathered around the fire and Colonel Sanford informed
the two hunters of their mission there.</p>

<p>“Be garry, and it’s Flick O’Flynn of Carricksfergus that
can bate in more rhed niggars’ skulls than any man on the job,
and yees kin count mees in on the parsuit av the ghal,
also. Wirra! but mees am in me glory when swinging me
old shillalah among the dirthy blackg’ards, so it is, so it&mdash;Har&mdash;rk!”</p>

<p>Though the Hibernian was talking quite boisterously, his
practiced ear caught a far-off and peculiar sound, coming
from the Black Hills.</p>

<p>“Ay, and didn’t ye hear thet, now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; what was it?” queried Sanford.</p>

<p>“It was a sound rhesembling the thuang av a horn&mdash;there
she am again!”</p>

<p>This time all heard it, and, true enough, it was the far-off
blast of a horn. Flick O’Flynn and Ebony exchanged inquiring
and ominous glances.</p>

<p>“A hunter, I suppose,” said young Rodman.</p>

<p>“Not a bit av it! It’s the gathering call av robbers, in
yonder hills,” said O’Flynn, pointing away westward over the
Black Hills.</p>

<p>“But what means <em>that</em>?” asked Willis Armond, pointing
up toward the dark sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>All eyes gazed upon the object in question with wonder
and surprise. It was a bright, glowing speck not unlike a
blazing star; but it was moving, drifting slowly through the
heavens&mdash;now east&mdash;now west&mdash;now sinking&mdash;now rising&mdash;now
circling around and around&mdash;again standing still against
the black canopy of heaven.</p>

<p>“That is surely not a star,” said Walter Lyman.</p>

<p>“No; but it’s a mystery to me,” said Colonel Sanford.</p>

<p>Again the twang of the horn was heard, and, as its echoes
rolled back through the hills, the mysterious blazing star was
seen to glide away through the heavens and disappear in a
moment behind the mountain range.</p>

<p>“That is a mystery that is not the agency of man,” said the
colonel.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lor’! I tell ye, Massa Sanfor’, our time am come!
Dat war de horn ob de ark-angel wakin’ up de dead.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool, Ebony; you’ve lost all the courage you
ever did possess.”</p>

<p>“I knows I’s a fool, massa, but I’s been a wicked nigger,
and de world am comin’ to a eend, and oh, Lor’ ob Heabens!
dar comes de Ole Nick&mdash;de Ole Nick!&mdash;de Ole Nick! after
dis chile&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!”</p>

<p>Ebony stretched out his hands as if to keep off some horrible
object. His eyes were lifted upward and glared like those of
a madman. His lips stood slightly apart, revealing his firm-set
teeth, and his features were convulsed with horror.</p>

<p>“Ebony! Ebony! are you going mad?” exclaimed Sanford,
excitedly.</p>

<p>The negro moved not a muscle nor his uplifted eyes, but,
at that instant, a fierce and terrible scream burst over the
heads of the little group. All started and lifted their eyes
upward, and as they did so, every face became blanched with
terror. They saw what Ebony saw, and startled as he did.
They saw not a human nor a beast, but an awful, terrible
figure&mdash;a figure resembling a human skeleton <em>floating through
the air, high over the tree-tops</em>, its ghastly proportions revealed
by the smoke and flame emitted from the sunken eyes, the
distended nostrils and the wide, grinning mouth. Great
white arms beat and buffeted the air like the wings of a
struggling vampire, while scream after scream pealed wild and<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
unearthly from the horrid creature’s lips. It was fully a
hundred feet above the tree-tops and moved swiftly&mdash;so swift,
that in a moment it had floated over the camp and disappeared
behind the dark hills.</p>

<p>The party stood transfixed with horror. Colonel Sanford
was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, what was it?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s de Ole Nick after dis poor, black nigger,”
persisted Ebony.</p>

<p>Flick O’Flynn acted quite indifferent. He showed but
little surprise at sight of the horrid creature, yet he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Holy Mother! it makes the hair sthand on mees head, and
polar icebergs rholl down me back, but then it’s not the first
time that Flick O’Flynn of Carricksfergus, has see’d thet
chreature.”</p>

<p>“What is it? beast, human, fiend or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ay, there now, and it’s the horrid chreature known as
the Aerial Demon of the Mountain.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A MOMENT OF PERIL.</span></h2>


<p>For some time the wildest excitement prevailed in the
hunters’ camp over what O’Flynn had said was the Aerial
Demon, the scourge of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>Flick could throw no light on the subject, further than that he
had seen it once before, and heard of its being seen by others,
and striking terror to the hearts of the Indians.</p>

<p>For fully an hour this aerial apparition was the subject of
conversation, and many and curious were the suppositions entertained
by the party as to its nature.</p>

<p>By this time the clouds had rolled away, and the blue dome
of heaven was glimmering with myriads of stars. The murky
shadows were lifted from the great plain that stretched away
in tranquil beauty like an ocean, broken now and then by a<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
silvery lake or stream, or a little woodland isle that nestled
down on its bosom like a mere black speck. And as the moments
stole by, a score of dusky forms suddenly emerged from
the shadow of one of those prairie islands, and moved silently
over the plain.</p>

<p>It was a band of hostile Cheyenne Indians, heading toward
the Black Hills.</p>

<p>As the night was far advanced, and Colonel Sanford and
his young friends were greatly fatigued with their long tramp
through the mountain, they concluded to remain with the
hunters until morning, inasmuch as they had promised to accompany
them on the morrow in pursuing the red-skins. The
fire was replenished with fuel. The flames leaped up and relieved
the gloom for many feet around; but backed in by the
great woods on one side, and the rise of a hill on the other,
the light was, as it were, pent up in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>And so it was hidden from the gaze of those on the near
plain but not to those on the hills, nor to those far out on
the plain.</p>

<p>Flick O’Flynn was to stand guard the rest of the night&mdash;he
refusing all offers of relief. He lit his pipe and seated himself
before the fire, with his shillalah lying across his knees.
The rest of the party stretched themselves in various attitudes
about the fire to rest.</p>

<p>Just then a night-bird fluttered overhead with a startled
scream. Every man sprung quickly to his feet. Was it the
Aerial Demon again? They glanced around them. No.
It was not the demon, but a sight equally as horrifying met
their gaze. Out from the deep gloom, into the glare of the
roaring camp-fire&mdash;with the silence of phantoms, their painted
visages aglow with diabolical triumph, their hands clutching
a knife or tomahawk, came a score of Cheyenne Indians, surrounding
our friends on every side like sheep in a slaughter-pen.
For a moment they paused just within the circle of
light; then they uttered a yell, so fierce that the blood stood
like ice in the veins of the whites.</p>

<p>“Och! and be the Howly Mother, it’s a sorry time we’ll
have,” exclaimed Flick O’Flynn, whirling his shillalah about
his head; “but here goes,” and he dashed among the savages
with a yell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>“And here comes dis chile,” exclaimed Ebony, clubbing his
rifle and following.</p>

<p>“We have got to fight for our lives,” said Colonel Sanford,
who, possessing no weapon, stooped and picked up a heavy
club, one end of which was afire, and swinging it aloft he
dashed in among the savages, Frank and Willis Armond,
Walter Lyman and Ralph Rodman following suit with clubbed
rifles.</p>

<p>The conflict instantly became fearful.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes were three to one, and our friends fought
with the desperation of despair&mdash;of madmen. Several savages
went down, but the death of each one made the survivors
all the more desperate; and presently Walter Lyman
fell unconscious from a blow on the head, and Willis Armond
received a severe wound on the arm. Defeat and death
stared our friends in the face&mdash;they were being gradually
overpowered&mdash;the savages were closing in upon them&mdash;another
moment&mdash;but hark! what sound was that? Was it
the voice of doom?</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MASTER OF THE EAGLE.</span></h2>


<p>It was the wild scream of a bird that fell upon the ears of
the combatants, but at the next instant a horseman dashed
wildly in among the savages, a drawn saber in hand. And
so swift did the stranger swing the polished weapon right
and left upon the tufted skulls of the red-skins that it seemed
a broad sheet of flame. Nor did this strange man come alone
to the rescue. A large, tame gray eagle accompanied him,
and the fierce bird seemed inspired with the same warlike
spirit of its master. Down into the savages’ faces, striking
with talon, beak and wing, swooped the great bird with a
scream, tearing and lacerating the flesh and eyes at every
stroke.</p>

<p>The scale of battle was turned as if by magic. The savages,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
defeated and terrified, fled into the shelter of the forest,
pursued by Ebony and the stranger’s fierce bird, leaving half
their number behind, dead.</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned upon their strange deliverer.</p>

<p>He was a young man, not more than thirty. In stature he
was about five feet six inches. His figure was firmly knit but
flexible; and every movement supple, easy and graceful.
His hair was of a dark brown, as was also his beard that in a
great measure concealed his face and hung to the pommel of
his saddle. A few premature wrinkles were faintly traced
about his eyes.</p>

<p>A tunic of blue velveteen ornamented with yellow fringe
and confined at the waist by a leather belt, buck-skin trowsers,
buck-skin leggings and moccasins, and a gray felt hat constituted
his garb.</p>

<p>A saber, a brace of revolvers in his belt, and a rifle that
was swung at his back by means of a strap passing over his
shoulder, were the weapons he carried.</p>

<p>The animal he rode was a black, mettlesome mustang with
arched neck and flashing eyes, clear limbs and muscular proportions.</p>

<p>A large, and what appeared cumbersome, pair of well-filled
saddle-bags were thrown over the cantle of the saddle, while
on one side hung a double field-glass, and on the other side
a coiled silver horn.</p>

<p>Replacing his saber in its scabbard, he turned and gazed
upon those he had rescued. From one to the other his eyes
wandered until they met those of Wayland Sanford, when a
strange, wild light flashed in them. A momentary silence ensued.
The horseman was the first to speak:</p>

<p>“A warm time you were having, my friends,” he said, in a
clear voice.</p>

<p>“Indeed we were,” replied the old colonel, with a nervous
tremor in his voice induced by exertion and excitement;
“and whom have we the honor of thanking for our rescue?”</p>

<p>“My name is Rodger Rainbolt,” replied the horseman, in
his clear, ringing voice, in which there was much of wild
bluntness; “and now your name if you please?”</p>

<p>“Wayland Sanford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>The ranger was silent for a moment, then he asked:</p>

<p>“What brings Wayland Sanford here in these wilds, dressed
in the fine clothes of a citizen?”</p>

<p>The colonel informed him of the abduction of his daughter,
and that they were in pursuit of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Uh-humph!” ejaculated the ranger, when he had heard
the colonel’s story.</p>

<p>At this moment Ebony returned from pursuit of the flying
savages, and, as the ranger’s eyes fell upon him, he turned his
animal so that the fire would not shine in his face.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Flick O’Flynn and Frank Armond were
busily engaged in restoring young Lyman to his senses, of
which a blow on the head had bereft him; while the young
surgeon, Ralph Rodman, turned his attention to Willis’ bleeding
arm.</p>

<p>“Do you know what tribe the Indians belong to that
captured your girl?” asked Rainbolt, after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“They were Cheyennes,” replied the colonel.</p>

<p>“Black Bear’s cut-throats, I suppose,” returned the handsome
ranger.</p>

<p>“Golly mighty!” suddenly exclaimed Ebony, peering up
into the ranger’s face as he spoke; “dat sounds jist like
Massa Walraven’s voice, as I’s a born nigger, but den it’s not
his face, for Massa Walraven died long ago&mdash;died at de Debbil’s
Tarn,” and he turned away.</p>

<p>The ranger flashed a quick glance upon Sanford, who was
moving uneasily; then in a tone of indifference said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will not succeed in rescuing your daughter
if Black Bear has reached or does reach his haunts.”</p>

<p>“God forbid that he should!” exclaimed Sanford.</p>

<p>“But,” continued the horseman, “since I am not particularly
engaged at present, I can and will devote my time to
assisting you in rescuing your girl. I wish, however, to act
strictly alone, for the assistance I have will enable me to do
so with success&mdash;but, I had entirely forgot my companion,”
and taking the silver horn from his saddle, he placed it to
his lips and blew a shrill blast.</p>

<p>Immediately after this act the winnowing of great wings
was heard, and a moment later the eagle that attacked the<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
savages so fiercely settled down from the gloom overhead
and perched itself upon the shoulder of the ranger. Blood
was on its talons and beak.</p>

<p>“A noble pet you have, Mr. Rainbolt,” said the colonel,
admiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; one that will be worth more to me in rescuing your
daughter than a dozen men. His instinct is wonderful and his
strength prodigious. One stroke of his wing, Mr. Sanford, would
break your arm as though it were a straw. I have known
him to carry in his talons a weight of a hundred pounds.
Ah, a noble bird is Echo, my eagle. He hates a red-skin with
all the bitterness of his master.”</p>

<p>“You must have had great patience in training him, Mr.
Rainbolt.”</p>

<p>“I do not claim all that honor. He was partly trained
when he came into my possession. He was given me by an
old Californian named Barker.”</p>

<p>“Barker!” burst involuntarily from Sanford’s lips; “Gustave
Barker?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Gustave Barker,” replied the ranger, eying the colonel
sharply. “Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;no, I have heard of him,” replied Sanford, recovering
from his sudden excitement.</p>

<p>There was a few moments’ silence, broken only by the impatient
pawing of the ranger’s steed.</p>

<p>Doctor Rodman had succeeded in restoring Lyman to his
senses, and had carefully dressed Willis’ arm, which, after
all, had only sustained a flesh-wound.</p>

<p>“I say, Lyman,” said the young physician, after his friend
had recovered his senses, “that blow you got on the head is
what is termed in legal phrase, ‘’Salt and battery,’ ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the young lawyer, rubbing his sore head;
“but, in this affair there is more ‘battery’ than ‘’sault’; however,
I shall bring action at once for damages.”</p>

<p>“And try the case before&mdash;what is it?&mdash;oh, yes; the Aerial
Demon,” said Willis, laughing.</p>

<p>“The Aerial Demon!” exclaimed Rainbolt, “have you
seen that horrid, mysterious creature?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it passed over our camp an hour or so ago. Can
you throw any light on the real nature of the mystery?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing more than that it is the most frightful object I
ever saw,” returned the ranger.</p>

<p>“Ay, now, and it’s yees that spakes the thruth loudly, for
it’s mees that’s see’d the chreature twice, and both times it
stharted polar icebergs down my back, so it did,” said Flick.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rainbolt, “since I can be of no further service
to you, gentlemen, I may as well take my departure.
Should I succeed in rescuing your daughter, Mr. Sanford, I
will communicate the fact to you at once,” and as he concluded,
he took from his pocket a time-worn memoranda, and
tearing out one of the stained leaves handed it to Colonel Sanford,
saying: “Read that, <em>Colonel</em> Wayland Sanford, and good-night
to you all,” and as he spoke the pet eagle arose into the
air&mdash;the spirited mustang pricked up its ears, champed its bit
impatiently, and the next moment Rodger Rainbolt, the ranger,
was gone.</p>

<p>“He’s a curious fellow&mdash;a living mystery,” said Ralph Rodman;
“but what ails you, colonel?&mdash;what ails you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing, nothing but excitement, as usual,” replied
the colonel, evasively; “but, let me see what the ranger wants
me to read.”</p>

<p>He turned and stirred up the waning camp-fire, and seating
himself upon the ground glanced at the paper. A groan
escaped his lips as he did so, and the paper dropped from his
hand, and falling into the fire was consumed in an instant,
while the colonel’s hands dropped to his knees and his eyes
became fixed upon the fire.</p>

<p>“What did he write, uncle?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>There was no response to his question.</p>

<p>Frank repeated it. Still no reply.</p>

<p>“The ranger has thrown the colonel’s mind into a quandary,”
said young Lyman.</p>

<p>“Like the red naygur did <em>yours</em>,” said Flick O’Flynn.</p>

<p>“How is it, colonel?” asked Rodman.</p>

<p>The colonel was still silent. Frank Armond advanced and
laid his hand upon his uncle’s shoulder, but he started back
with a thrill of horror. The limbs of the colonel were rigid
as death; his eyes were still fixed upon the fire with a cold,
glassy, vacant stare. His lips stood slightly apart and his features
were ghastly as the dead’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Uncle! uncle!” exclaimed Frank, shaking him violently,
“what ails you? Come, rouse up&mdash;great God, what can it
mean, Rodman?”</p>

<p>The young doctor was bending over the colonel, his fingers
resting upon the old man’s pulse.</p>

<p>“Come, speak, Ralph, what does it mean?” repeated Frank.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” exclaimed the young doctor, starting up, “what
could the ranger have written? It has killed the colonel, as
God’s in Heaven, boys; he is <em>dead&mdash;stone dead</em>!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A ROBBER ROBBED.</span></h2>


<p>The blood-red sun hung low in the western heavens, its
usual brightness partly obscured by the blue mist that hung
over the mountain and plain. The Black Hills lay dimly outlined
against the murky sky. In the vast expanse of mountain
and plain, but a single <em>living</em> object could be seen. That
object was a large bird poised aloft above a narrow defile, or
valley, in the Black Hills. For some time it seemed to hang
motionless on the air, then it descended down, down until it
was lost in the mountain shadows; then it darted up again,
with a wild scream from the valley, its keen eyes fixed on
some object far below. And what think you it was that
Echo, the eagle, saw there?</p>

<p>It was a beautiful glade in the greenwood valley. A camp-fire
burning in the center of the glade. A number of Indians
seated around the fire. Several lodges standing in the background.
An Indian encampment.</p>

<p>But two of the Indians claim our especial notice. The
young chief, Allacotah, and his beautiful wife, Silver Voice.</p>

<p>The young chief sat apart from his companions, apparently
in deep thought. Presently, the light figure of an Indian woman
glided from one of the lodges in the background and approached
him. She was young, not more than three and
twenty. Her movements were graceful as the fawn’s; her<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
voice as sweet and clear as the chimes of a silver bell. She
was dressed in a short frock of some green material, beautifully
ornamented with Indian handiwork, while beaded moccasins
and white-fringed buck-skin leggings incased her feet
and ankles.</p>

<p>Approaching and laying her hand upon Allacotah’s shoulder,
she said, in pure English:</p>

<p>“Allacotah, my husband, seems thoughtful.”</p>

<p>The young chief raised his eyes and gazed into those of his
wife.</p>

<p>“That is true,” he replied; “but the voice of my beautiful
wife cheers me, though I was only thinking&mdash;thinking of our
great chief, Black Bear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied the beautiful Indian woman; “it had
not occurred to my mind before, that to-day Black Bear was
to return from the great wigwams of the pale-faces.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and may his heart not be filled with evil when he
comes. Black Bear is a bad man. He causes much trouble
between the pale-faces and my people. He has made many
widows and orphans among the great Cheyenne nation&mdash;waged
war till Cheyenne blood flowed like water.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two miles from the Indian encampment on a high, bold
bluff stood Rodger Rainbolt, the ranger. One hand was resting
upon his animal’s arched neck, while with the other he
held his spy-glass to his eyes as he watched a tiny dark speck
in the misty sky before him. That speck was Echo, his
eagle.</p>

<p>“Yes, there <em>are</em> Indians there,” he muttered to himself,
“and perhaps they are the ones that I am in pursuit of.
Echo, noble, sagacious bird, has traced them out, and now he
marks the spot by poising himself in the air&mdash;now by descending&mdash;now
rising again&mdash;now circling around and around.
Ah, noble bird! he circles away, away; he knows his mission
is done for the present, and now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He lowered his glass and taking the coiled horn from his
saddle, placed it to his lips and blew a shrill, prolonged blast,
which, as it echoed far back over the hills, reached the ear
of the eagle, and immediately it headed its flight toward its
master. In a few minutes it was perched upon his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“Your work is well done, Echo,” said the ranger, caressing
the bird, “and I have only to await darkness to accomplish
mine.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Cheyenne encampment was only a temporary one, the
permanent village of Black Bear being located several miles
south-west within the southern extremities of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the return of Black Bear, or Blufe Brandon,
preparations were made for his reception; for a mounted
messenger had arrived in camp during the day and informed
Allacotah and his braves that Black Bear, with a beautiful
captive, and accompanied by several of his warriors, would
arrive there some time during the evening.</p>

<p>As the time for the coming of the distinguished <em>white</em> chief
drew near, and darkness gathered around, preparations were
hastily made for his reception.</p>

<p>Presently a wild yell announced the expected arrival.</p>

<p>The name Black Bear had a significant meaning as applied
to the Renegade, Blufe Brandon. Had one who had never
seen him in his disguise, beheld him when he entered the
lodge of Allacotah, they would have started up with sudden
fear, for there was nothing natural in his appearance.</p>

<p>The villain was completely disguised in the skin of a black
bear, even the head of the animal rested upon that of his own
with its round, glaring eyes, its open mouth, red tongue and
white fangs in lifelike presentation. As the nose of the animal
projected over the head of the renegade, the face of the
latter was completely concealed by long, straggling hairs hanging
from the under jaw of the animal’s head, yet the ruffian’s
eyes shone through the hairy mask like those of a serpent
through the dark. His arms and legs were wrapped in the
skin carefully taken from the animal’s limbs with the long
claws attached, and dextrously fixed to his toes and fingers&mdash;thus
perfecting his disguise so completely that he looked
like a bear walking erect upon his hind feet.</p>

<p>In his arms the renegade carried Silvia Sanford, who a
few minutes before their arrival had fainted from sheer exhaustion,
long fasting and excessive heat.</p>

<p>A rug of skins and robes was laid near the fire, and the pale
and beautiful captive placed upon it. Black Bear then turned<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
to Silver Voice and requested her to look after the maiden’s
wants, and assist the medicine-man in restoring her to consciousness.</p>

<p>Silver Voice advanced, and bending over the captive, gazed
into her pretty, pale face. A low cry escaped her lips, and
beckoning her husband she pointed down, and said: “Does it
not look&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind what the girl looks like, but hasten to restore
her. That girl’s life is worth ten thousand dollars to me.”</p>

<p>It was Black Bear who spoke, his voice sounding hoarse and
hollow beneath his hairy mask. Allacotah was a chief of
power and distinction, but Black Bear was his superior&mdash;hence
the latter’s authoritative, indignant command.</p>

<p>Silver Voice, with the assistance of Allacotah, began the
task of restoring the captive to consciousness. Water was
brought from a spring hard by and the brow of the maiden
bathed. A cordial made of some wild herbs was administered,
and by a vigorous chafing of the limbs and temples, Silvia
was brought back to life.</p>

<p>“Put her in <em>there</em>,” said Black Bear, pointing with his claw-clad
finger to Silver Voice’s lodge; “the presence of so many
warriors might excite her too much. She must have rest and
food.”</p>

<p>Allacotah lifted her in his strong arms and carried her
into the lodge where Silver Voice had arranged a neat, comfortable
couch of skins. Laying her upon the couch, the
chief went out, leaving the two women alone.</p>

<p>Silvia opened her eyes and gazed around.</p>

<p>There was a fat-lamp, made in a rude stone-bowl, burning
in the lodge, and by it Silvia was enabled to see where she
was. All around her wore an air of neatness. The floor
of the lodge was laid with a carpet of buffalo-robes, and
the walls of the cone-shaped structure were hung with
beautiful tapestry of buck-skin, highly and artistically ornamented.
Strands of wampum, stuffed birds of beautiful
plumage, curious figures carved from wood and stone were
arranged around the walls. The only object of civilization
to be seen was a small, cracked mirror.</p>

<p>When the captive saw the beautiful Indian woman tending
over her with tears in her eyes, her heart beat with gentle hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“Rest easy, dear girl,” said Silver Voice, kindly, “you are
greatly fatigued.”</p>

<p>“Where am I? and who are you with the tender voice and
angelic face?” asked Silvia, rising to a sitting posture and
gazing around, her mind still confused and bewildered.</p>

<p>“You are in the encampment of Allacotah, and I am Silver
Voice, Allacotah’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Where is Black Bear?”</p>

<p>“The inhuman wretch is out by the camp-fire,” the woman
replied, bitterly.</p>

<p>Silvia was surprised by her manner of speech. She saw
that the Indian woman entertained a feeling of intense dislike
toward the chief.</p>

<p>“Then you do not respect the great chief,” said Silvia,
“judging from your remarks.”</p>

<p>“No, I hate him!” she fairly hissed, “the inhuman, merciless
outcast of his own race!”</p>

<p>“And do not his warriors like him?” asked Silvia.</p>

<p>“Yes; those whose hearts are vile as his,” Silver Voice
answered, “and, dear girl,” she continued, coming closer and
speaking lower, “if it’s in my power, and the power of Allacotah,
you shall never, <em>never</em> suffer captivity at his hands!”</p>

<p>Silvia’s face brightened; then it became clouded again as
she said:</p>

<p>“But he told me he was going to sell me to a robber-captain&mdash;that
the robber had promised him a great reward for
me, but how a robber-captain here in the Black Hills knew
me is quite a mystery.”</p>

<p>“Did he mention the robber-captain’s name?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe it was Dungarvon&mdash;Duval Dungarvon.”</p>

<p>“God have mercy!” exclaimed the woman, frantically.
“Duval Dungarvon! Duval Dungarvon! Oh, dear girl, better
take your own life than fall into the hands of that man.
He is a fiend, a devil! It is not your beauty, nor his love for
you that makes him desirous of possessing you, but it is to
torture you, and grind, grind your father’s heart out for revenge&mdash;bitter,
<em>bitter</em>, <span class="smcap">BITTER</span> revenge!” and the beautiful woman
fairly raved in her excitement.</p>

<p>Silvia was completely mystified by her strange words&mdash;her
wild emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“I do not understand you, Silver Voice,” she said.</p>

<p>Before the Indian woman could reply, a wild commotion
among the savages outside arrested her attention. She turned
and went out, and Silvia involuntarily arose and followed her.</p>

<p>The women were greatly surprised to see the savages, their
faces convulsed with horror&mdash;their eyes lifted upward with a
terrified stare, speechless and motionless. Following the direction
indicated by their startled gaze, the women became
equally as terrified.</p>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>Down the valley from the north floated in the air high
above the tree-tops&mdash;far above the reach and power of man,
an awful figure&mdash;the figure of a human skeleton, its ghastly
proportions revealed by the flame and smoke emitted from the
great sunken eyes, the distended nostrils and wide, grinning
mouth. Great white arms beat and buffeted the air like the
wings of a struggling vampire, while scream after scream rent
the air.</p>

<p>It was the Aerial Demon of the Mountain, the scourge of
the Black Hills&mdash;the terror of the Indian.</p>

<p>Silvia’s face became white with terror, and she was compelled
to cling to Silver Voice for support.</p>

<p>“Come into the lodge, dear girl,” said the chief’s wife, in a
whisper, “it is the Aerial Demon.”</p>

<p>They turned toward the door of the little cone-shaped structure.
Just then the clatter of iron-shod hoofs coming up the
stony valley caught their ears. They stopped.</p>

<p>The next instant a white man, mounted upon a mettlesome
animal, dashed from the gloom and stopped so quickly by the
side of the terrified women that his animal was thrown back
upon its haunches.</p>

<p>It was Rodger Rainbolt, the ranger!</p>

<p>Before Black Bear and his savages could draw their attention
from the Aerial Demon&mdash;which in a moment, almost, had
passed over the camp and disappeared&mdash;the daring ranger
leaned forward in his stirrups&mdash;placed his arm about Silvia’s
waist&mdash;lifted her from the ground as though she had been an
infant&mdash;whirled his animal southward and dashed away into
the gloom of the forest, pursued by Black Bear and his warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>As the ranger turned his animal he gave Silver Voice one
quick glance that seemed to pierce her to the heart. She
threw up her hands&mdash;clutched wildly at space&mdash;uttered a
low, convulsive sob and sunk unconscious into the arms of
her husband, Allacotah.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE HIDDEN HOME.</span></h2>


<p>Away through the dark wood and down the mountain defile,
the ranger dashed with his precious burden.</p>

<p>Silvia uttered no word of fear, no cry of pain. She had
caught a glimpse of the ranger’s noble, handsome face as he
lifted her from the ground in the Indian encampment, and,
as if by magic, her heart became inspired with confidence in
him.</p>

<p>“Fear not, Miss Sanford,” the stranger breathed in her
ear when they had fairly cleared the Indian encampment;
“you are safe with a friend.”</p>

<p>“A friend&mdash;a noble, daring friend, yet a stranger that
knows my name,” replied Silvia, in a voice slightly agitated.</p>

<p>“That’s true, Miss Sanford; but I learned your name from
your father.”</p>

<p>“Father!” exclaimed the maiden. “Oh, where and when
did you see my father?”</p>

<p>“I saw him less than twenty-fours ago, but many miles
from here. He was in search of you.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” breathed the maiden; “but who am I
indebted to for my rescue and the information?”</p>

<p>“My name is Rodger Rainbolt; I am a ranger, a rude,
rough man of the plains.”</p>

<p>“Your bravery and unselfishness, Mr. Rainbolt, are nobler
virtues than the cultivated politeness of refinement.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me, Miss Sanford, and I hope it is rightfully
bestowed,” was the reply, and then both became silent for a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>Presently they emerged from the dark forest into an open
and level plain, through which wound a little stream like a
silver thread. All around it arose a dark belt of wooded hills
like a beautiful landscape set in a rusty frame.</p>

<p>Away to the north could be heard the roar of falling
water.</p>

<p>The blue mist that hung over the mountain at the beginning
of night had cleared away from the face of the sky, and
the great round moon looked out in all its queenly splendor,
lighting up the little valley with a soft, dreamy light.</p>

<p>Halting on the summit of a little knoll overlooking the plain,
the ranger lifted Silvia to the ground, and then, dismounting
himself, stood by her side.</p>

<p>“We rest here,” he said. “Look yonder, and tell me what
you see.”</p>

<p>“I can see a broad, silvery surface, resembling a tiny lake,
sleeping there, just where the black wood begins.”</p>

<p>“It is not a lake, Miss Sanford, but a broad sheet of water
falling over a high, jutting rock, in which is my cavern home&mdash;my
castle.”</p>

<p>Silvia felt a chill creep over her frame as she thought:
“What if he is a robber, or an escaped criminal&mdash;a base villain,
leading me into his lair; but no; it can not be possible
that an evil heart lies concealed behind that noble, handsome
face. He has saved me from the tortures of Indian captivity,
or perhaps a worse fate, and I will not entertain, for a moment,
one disrespectful thought of him.</p>

<p>“I should think you would get lonesome here, Mr. Rainbolt,”
she finally said.</p>

<p>“That may all be,” he replied, gravely. “But I can do no
better, and I offer you the hospitality of my secluded home&mdash;that
is, if you have no scruples of going there alone with
me.”</p>

<p>“Why should I, Mr. Rainbolt, when to you I owe my life?
I feel perfectly free&mdash;yes, proud, to trust your honesty, manhood
and protection.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope you will never have cause to feel other
wise, though, were there any settlements or residences within
forty miles, I would take you there at once. But there is
none nearer than those on Laramie plains, fifty miles distant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“But should you take me there, I would not, in all probability,
meet father for a long time.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Miss Sanford; but would you prefer riding
to walking across this plain to the creek?”</p>

<p>“No, I had rather walk, as I am much fatigued with riding,
already.”</p>

<p>“Then I will turn my horse to pasture here,” said the ranger,
removing the saddle and bridle from the animal, which
at once began cropping the rich, succulent grass.</p>

<p>Having removed the capacious saddle-bags from the saddle,
he concealed the caparisons in a small cavity in the knoll on
which they were standing, and then, slinging the saddle-bags
across his shoulder, he took Silvia’s hand and set off across
the little valley.</p>

<p>It was only a few moments’ walk, and when the stream
was reached the ranger drew a small canoe from under some
drooping willows, and launched it. In a moment he was seated
therein, with his fair companion, and taking up the paddle,
drove the little craft out into the middle of the stream; then
turned and moved up its course.</p>

<p>So swift, so easily did the canoe glide over the rippling
waters, that Silvia, for a moment, forgot the surrounding danger,
and conversed with her handsome rescuer with a real
sense of joy and admiration.</p>

<p>Presently the sullen roar of falling waters reached their
ears.</p>

<p>“It is the Crystal Falls, Miss Sanford, that you hear,” said
the ranger; “we will soon be there.”</p>

<p>In a few moments more the falls burst upon their view
like a great silver curtain suspended against a black wall.</p>

<p>In the rock, over which the waters fell like a great apron,
was the ranger’s secret home, the water concealing from view
the entrance, which could only be reached by passing through
the descending torrent.</p>

<p>“Behind that wall of water, Miss Sanford, is my home, and
to reach it we must pass <em>through</em> the descending sheet; and
as it will be pitchy dark beyond, and the windings of the cavern
are difficult to follow, I had better go in alone, light a
torch, and return to you. You can wait there upon that rock,
can you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” replied Silvia, springing to her feet.</p>

<p>Alongside the canoe was a rock, some three feet across, and
projecting several inches above the surface of the stream.
Upon this Silvia stepped to await the ranger’s return. He
took up the paddle and drove the canoe forward, and when
he had disappeared in the mist and spray, a feeling akin to
terror crept over the maiden. But she could only wait&mdash;listen
to the roar of the falls and the black waters chafing the
rock on which she stood. And as she lifted her eyes and
followed the dark summit of the ridge that rose up before her,
what dark objects were those she saw moving athwart the
clear sky?</p>

<p>They were savages, though Silvia did not know it.</p>

<p>Presently a light streamed through the mist and falling
water, and looking, Silvia saw that the latter had been parted
near the middle, and about ten feet above the stream by some
contrivance of the ranger, and that the light was burning in
the mouth of the cavern, several feet beyond.</p>

<p>In a moment the canoe with the ranger shot out through
the opening and came alongside the rock where Silvia stood.
Assisting her in as though she had been a child, the kind-hearted
ranger took a gum blanket that he had brought from
the cavern, and wrapped it, hood-like, over her head and
shoulders, that the spray and dropping water might not drench
her. He then took up the paddle and drove the canoe through
the mist and vapor, between the parted waters of the falls,
and as far beyond as the water had backed beneath the jutting
rock.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Miss Sanford,” said Rainbolt, removing the
blanket from Silvia’s head and shoulders.</p>

<p>She glanced around and above. A glaring pine torch,
fixed in a niche in the wall, lit up the place. From the rim
of the canoe a spiral row of stone steps led up into the great
rock. Overhead the rocky ceiling was studded with countless
numbers of stalactites, on the sharp points of which hung
drops of water that flashed like so many diamonds. Here
and there a little jet of water poured down in ribbons of
foam.</p>

<p>“This,” said the ranger, pointing to a kind of sweep fixed
upon a pivot, and reaching out like a great arm, “is what I<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
divide the waters of the falls with, while I am passing in and
out of the cavern. By allowing that end to hang down as it
does, it reaches through the descending sheet of water and
divides it as it now is; and then by simply lowering this end
and hoisting that, thus, the waters close and flow on just as
they did before.”</p>

<p>He took her hand and assisted her from the boat, and then,
lifting the glowing torch from the wall, they began ascending
the rude stone steps. The ascent required much care and
time, for the stones were easily displaced and a single misstep
might prove fatal; but, finally, the top was reached and a
dark, capacious chamber was spread out before them. The
ranger stopped and held the torch above his head.</p>

<p>Silvia started back with a low cry of terror, for the light
flashed upon the form of a huge panther crouched at her
feet.</p>

<p>“Fear not, Miss Sanford,” said the ranger; “he will not
harm you. It is Purle, my pet panther. I should have
spoken of him before and saved you this sudden affright.
Ay, Purle, my pet.”</p>

<p>The panther sprung up and capered around its master
with apparent joy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” suddenly exclaimed Rainbolt, while caressing the
beautiful creature, “I had forgotten that my other pet, Echo,
my eagle, is still out. I will conduct you to your room, Miss
Sanford, and then call him in.”</p>

<p>They moved along the rocky chamber that resounded sepulchral
with their footfalls, the panther skipping playfully
before them. Presently they came to where a curtain or
partition of skins was stretched from one wall to the other.
Lifting one corner of it they passed beyond.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the ranger, with a smile of embarrassment,
“you are in the kitchen of Rodger Rainbolt, your humble
servant. You will not find things here, even as you would
in a bachelor’s kitchen in Omaha, but men are poor housekeepers,
you know.”</p>

<p>Silvia was surprised with the neatness of the apartment,
and the order and variety of its furniture; but she said nothing,
fearing that the ranger might construe her language of
praise as that of unmeaning and polite compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>Another partition of skins hanging at right-angles with the
first, separated the kitchen from another apartment into which
the ranger conducted the maiden.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, “is my sitting-room, parlor, bedroom
and library all combined. And now, pray be seated, Miss
Sanford, and make yourself at home while I go and bring
my eagle up. You see I think a great deal of my pets,” and,
lighting a lamp that sat near, he turned and went out.</p>

<p>The apartment in which the young girl now found herself
was far more comfortable than could have been expected
under the circumstances, and was well lighted by a large
lamp of stone filled with bear’s oil. In a short time the ranger
returned, bringing in the eagle, and then announced his
intention of preparing supper, asking Silvia to be seated until
his return.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour he again entered, bearing in his
hands a rude but ample repast, and with appetite sharpened
by the long ride, they partook of, and thoroughly enjoyed
the meal.</p>

<p>After supper was over the ranger made known to his guest
the programme he had adopted for her restoration to her
father, which met her hearty approval. She was to remain
there until he could find her father and bring him there, or
take her to where he was.</p>

<p>By this time the night was near, and the ranger seeing
that the eyes of his guest were growing heavy for want of
sleep, he arose and turning to leave the room said:</p>

<p>“As you are doubtless sleepy and fatigued, Miss Sanford,
you can appropriate this room and that pallet of furs, such
as it is, for your own sleeping apartment and retire whenever
you feel so disposed.”</p>

<p>He bid her good night and went into the other apartment,
where he constructed him a couch and laid down, his panther
curled down at his feet and his eagle perched in a niche in
the rocky wall.</p>

<p>Having offered up a fervent prayer to her Heavenly
Father, Silvia sought her couch and soon she was wrapt in a
sound, refreshing slumber.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">AN IRISHMAN’S RUSE.</span></h2>


<p>The greatest excitement prevailed in the hunters’ camp
over the sudden, mysterious death of Wayland Sanford.
Every thing within the young doctor’s power was done in
hopes of restoring him to life, but all to no purpose. His
limbs were cold and stiff, and his eyes, though wide open,
had that stony, glassy stare and his face the ghastly pallor of
the dead.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, boys; he’s gone,” said the young doctor;
“his death by apoplexy was caused by over-exertion and mental
excitement.</p>

<p>“Poor uncle Wayland!” sighed Frank. “We have all been
afraid of this for years. He was a victim of the heart-disease
and had a nervous and excitable temperament to aggravate it,
and alas! the abduction of his daughter, the wearisome pursuit
without food and rest, and finally, that paper placed in
his hand by the ranger, did the work.”</p>

<p>“But why should it?” asked young Lyman.</p>

<p>“That’s what I can not tell,” replied Frank. “Uncle Wayland
has been a man of the world&mdash;has spent much of his life
away from home among strangers, in California, in Pike’s
Peak, in the army upon the frontier, and to me his life has
been a sealed book&mdash;a secret volume in which this very Rainbolt
may be an important character.”</p>

<p>The lifeless form was placed upon a blanket near the fire,
the rigid limbs straightened out, and the pale hands folded
across his breast.</p>

<p>Ebony Jim burst into a paroxysm of sorrow, as he looked
down upon the pale face of the colonel.</p>

<p>“What is he to you, more than a stranger, Ebony? and
why do you mourn over him?” asked Willis.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lor’! and wasn’t he de father of poor Florence
Walraven?”</p>

<p>“And what about Florence? what do you know of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>“Why, wasn’t she de wife of Warren Walraven? and
wasn’t poor Massa Walraven de good master ob dis poor, black
nigger?”</p>

<p>“And what about your master and the Devil’s Tarn of
which he forbade you speaking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lor’! don’t ask dat,” the negro replied, glancing
toward the form of the colonel. “I fears him,” pointing to
the dead.</p>

<p>“He is dead; you need not fear him now.”</p>

<p>“De spirit ain’t dead&mdash;no, no; I’ll tells you some time, not
now.”</p>

<p>Ebony was obstinate, and as Frank could elicit no information
from him he turned away, greatly mystified.</p>

<p>By this time day was breaking, and before long the sun
arose clear and warm.</p>

<p>Flick O’Flynn went out in search of food for breakfast, and
soon returned with a quarter of deer-meat. A fire was struck
and a great quantity of the venison roasted.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, a sad duty was to be performed&mdash;the duty
of interring the colonel’s body.</p>

<p>An hour was spent in digging a shallow grave; the dirt being
loosened with hunting-knives and thrown out by the hands.
The form of the colonel was now wrapped in a blanket taken
from the shoulders of one of the dead Indians, his face covered
with his hat, and then laid away in the narrow sepulcher.</p>

<p>This sad duty performed, a council was held, and after due
consideration it was decided that Frank Armond and Walter
Lyman, with the Irishman, should pursue a southward direction
through the Black Hills, while Willis Armond and Ralph
Rodman, accompanied by Ebony Jim, should take a south-westerly
course, and in case they did not overtake the savages
before they reached their village, they were all to meet at a
certain point near the stronghold known to the hunters, when
they would make other arrangements.</p>

<p>Scarcely an hour after their departure, a score of savages
emerged from the forest into the little glade, and, as their eyes
fell upon the lifeless forms of their friends lying around, they
uttered a wild, revengeful cry, and turning, they glided away
into the woods like so many blood-hounds, directly upon the
trail of the white men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>The course of Flick O’Flynn and party lay through the
heart of the Black Hills, and over a rough, mountainous region,
but they pushed rapidly ahead, hoping to overtake the
savages before reaching the village.</p>

<p>The first day’s travel found them but fifteen miles from
where they had started in the morning. At the end of the
second day’s journey, they went into camp about two miles
from the Medicine Bow river.</p>

<p>Almost wearied out, Walter and Frank stretched themselves
upon the ground to talk over their serious predicament, while
the Irishman struck a fire by which to prepare supper. But
unfortunately, when the fire was struck there was nothing to
prepare for supper, so O’Flynn proposed to go in search of
game, leaving the young men at camp.</p>

<p>In a few moments after his departure, the young unskilled
sportsmen seemed to forget the caution enjoined upon them
by the hunter, and producing a pack of cards, concluded to
indulge in the pleasant pastime of “seven-up,” until the loquacious
friend and guide returned. However, the beginning
of the game seemed to have been ominous of evil, for at that
moment, four dark figures glided from the deepening shadows
of the woods with a hideous yell, and, ere the young men had
time to realize “the run of the game,” they were stretched
upon the ground and bound hand and foot, prisoners in the
hands of the Cheyennes.</p>

<p>Having secured their prisoners they set off toward the river,
compelling the whites, with their hands tied behind their
backs, to walk in advance.</p>

<p>In the mean time Flick was continuing his hunt.</p>

<p>He had pursued his course across the bottom to the river
without finding any game, and turning, he proceeded down
the stream. He had gone but a short distance in this direction
when he spied a large canoe with a solitary Indian in it,
moored near the bank. The savage evidently was waiting
for some one, judging from the impatient look he would now
and then flash into the woods at his side. Simultaneous with
the discovery of the Indian, the Irishman heard a loud yell
in the direction of the camp, and well he knew its import.
But, to be certain, he turned and hastened back toward his
friends, and as he neared the camp he saw that his fears were<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
confirmed. Frank and Walter were prisoners and were being
conducted through the forest toward the river.</p>

<p>The savages were going directly toward that point on the
river where he had seen the Indian in the canoe, and he knew
full well that he was one of the same party. So, turning, he
ran with all possible speed back to the river. He reached
the bank several rods above where the Indian still sat in the
canoe, and, dropping upon his hands and knees, he began
crawling down toward the red-skin.</p>

<p>It was his object to put the savage out the way, and as he
did not wish to raise an alarm by firing his gun he resolved
to trust in his shillalah.</p>

<p>The Indian was seated with his face down the stream, and,
as Flick approached him, he discovered him to be a half-breed.
He was dressed in an old ragged suit of clothes, no doubt
taken from some white victim. An old straw hat surmounted
his head, with what little there remained of the
brim lopped down over his eyes almost concealing his face.</p>

<p>Flick crawled on with the silence of a shadow, and had
nearly reached the canoe when his foot caught in a vine and
he was thrown heavily to the ground, making no little confusion.
An involuntary oath escaped his lips as he sprung
up and prepared to flee, but to his surprise he saw the Indian
never moved.</p>

<p>“Success to mees’ plan, he’s dafe!” muttered the hunter, and
he moved on toward the red-skin.</p>

<p>He had almost succeeded in reaching the water’s edge when
the savage turned his head and saw him. In a moment the
red-man snatched up his tomahawk from the bottom of the
canoe and hurled it at the head of the Irishman. But the
latter divined his intention, and falling flat upon his face in
the mud, the weapon passed harmlessly over. The savage did
not utter a single word nor sound, and it was quite evident
now that he was both <em>deaf</em> and <em>dumb</em>.</p>

<p>“And sthill so much the better,” exclaimed the Irishman,
and quicker than thought he sprung up and into the canoe,
and giving the half-breed a tap on the head, settled him down
perfectly unconscious.</p>

<p>In a minute the Irishman had stripped him of his ragged
clothes and donned them himself. As the Indian was the<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
largest man, he (Flick) had no trouble in putting the clothes
on over his own, and with the two suits on he appeared
fully as large as the red-skin and equally as woeful.</p>

<p>Flick then saw a little bark canoe resting under some willows
that fringed the bank. Drawing it out he placed the
unconscious half-breed therein and sent him adrift, knowing
that ere he recovered his senses he would be far enough
away.</p>

<p>So far things had worked like a charm, and having smeared
his face and hands with a pigment of dark clay, and drawing
the old hat-brim down over his eyes, the disguise was
completed, trusting to the gathering twilight to hide all imperfections.</p>

<p>Flick now concealed his shillalah under his ragged coat,
his rifle under the seat of the capacious canoe, and then,
procuring the savage’s tomahawk, took his seat in the canoe.</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly dark, and, inasmuch as Flick
was to play the part of a deaf and dumb Indian, he felt perfectly
safe in his daring feat to rescue his friends, but, when
he saw the savages emerge from the woods and approach
the canoe, his heart almost ceased to beat through fear of being
detected.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ENTRAPPED.</span></h2>


<p>Through his perfect knowledge of the country, Ebony Jim
with his party succeeded in making about twenty miles the
first day. They then encamped on the edge of a small glade,
on three sides of which arose the dark woods, while on the
fourth side a tall, jutting rock, some fifty feet high, frowned
down on the little glade. At the base of this rock our friends
selected their camp, which would not only afford a shelter
from the heavy, chilly dew, but a protection from an Indian
attack in the rear.</p>

<p>Something like an hour had passed, during which time
Willis and Ralph had expressed a wish for a little excitement<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
to keep them awake. In the mean time the practiced eyes of
Ebony had espied several dark forms moving to and fro along
the edge of the timber, but within its shadow.</p>

<p>That they meant harm the negro knew well enough, and
he resolved at once to make them “show their hand.” Saying
nothing, he crept out of the camp, and securing good
cover awaited the red-skins’ approach. Not long did he wait,
however, for soon the head and breast of a red-painted
warrior appeared, scanning the glade camp with basilisk eyes.
Ebony was on the alert with a novel weapon&mdash;a round stone
of the size of a hen’s egg. Without noise he threw the stone
with wonderful power and precision, striking the savage square
in the forehead, and without a groan the Cheyenne fell forward
upon his face&mdash;a dead man.</p>

<p>“Hi-hi!” the negro chuckled; “guess dat imp’s squaw’ll be
waitin’ a good while for her next beatin’.”</p>

<p>Not another savage appeared; and Ebony returned to camp
to watch and wait.</p>

<p>Two or three hours passed without any demonstration on
the part of the savages, and the watchful whites began to congratulate
themselves on their enemies’ having withdrawn, when,
suddenly, the whole heavens over them became lit up with
the glare of the mid-day sun, and the next moment a great
ball of dry, matted pine brush came rolling over the edge of
the cliff, wrapped in a sheet of red, hissing flame. It fell at
the feet of our friends, lighting up their hiding-place with a
blinding glare, and exposing them to the savages’ aim, while
to them all was inky gloom beyond the radius of light made
by the burning brush.</p>

<p>There was no alternative but to take to the woods.</p>

<p>“Foller dis nigga, boys!” exclaimed Ebony, springing from
under the rock and rushing across the opening.</p>

<p>Willis and Ralph did as commanded, and they all would
have succeeded in reaching the shelter of the wood safely, but,
unfortunately, Ralph stumbled, and before he could gain his
feet he was seized by a number of savages that lay in ambush
near, and made prisoner.</p>

<p>Ebony and Willis saw their companion captured, but, as
they could render no assistance against such fearful odds, they
dashed on and made good their escape into the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>They could hear the yell of the Indians back at the cliff,
and to ascertain what was going on they crept back to a
point of observation. They saw the red-skins, a score in number,
grouped around the captive under the edge of the cliff,
but of course they could not tell what disposition they were
going to make of him.</p>

<p>For some time the negro sat in a deep study. Presently he
started up with what he considered a “bright idea,” and which
he at once communicated to Willis.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, had the savages under the cliff glanced
across the opening, they would have seen the body of their
comrade, that was slain by the negro, dragged from the edge
of the glade by some invisible power, into the clump of shrubbery
some ten feet away. This was done by Ebony fixing the
screw of his ramrod in a long pole which he slid along upon
the ground until it came in contact with the savage’s body;
he then twisted the screw into the dead fellow’s garments and
dragged him into the brush&mdash;for what purpose will soon be
shown.</p>

<p>The savages did not notice the disappearance of their comrade’s
body, so intent were they in the council that was being
held to determine the fate of their captive. Some were in
favor of tomahawking him on the spot, some of burning him,
and some one thing and some another. Finally, it was settled
that the captive select his own choice of death, from burning,
the tomahawk, and jumping from the cliff overhead.</p>

<p>The choice was rather a difficult one. Death by the tomahawk
and jumping from the cliff would be instantaneous,
while by burning, his chances of being rescued by Ebony and
Willis would be prolonged as well as his suffering. And so
he took his choice of death by burning at the stake.</p>

<p>The captive’s hands were free, but his legs were bound so
tightly that the bonds cut the flesh, and in this manner he
was compelled to stand perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>In a moment all hands were busied in erecting a stake in
the center of the glade, gathering fuel and making other preparations
for the grand torture; and while thus engaged, a
voice suddenly rung out on the night air, clear and distinct:</p>

<p>“Seize the rope, Rodman; seize the rope!”</p>

<p>All eyes were involuntarily drawn toward the woods across<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
the moonlit opening, whence the voice had emanated, and at
that instant Ralph Rodman, the doomed captive, <em>arose from the
ground</em>, floated upward, upward, upward through the air&mdash;up
along the face of the cliff; and when the savages again
turned, they found he had vanished from their midst like mist
before the morning sun&mdash;gone they knew not where; but,
suddenly, a great black object leaped from the edge of the
cliff overhead, and falling in their midst crushed half their
number to atoms. It was a huge stone, rolled over the cliff by
Ebony Jim, who had also saved Ralph by drawing him up
with a rope made of the dead Indian’s buck-skin garments,
and lowered at the moment that the savages’ attention was
drawn toward the woods.</p>

<p>Thus Ebony’s “bright idea” had proved a success. While
Willis remained in the woods to draw the attention of the
savages, at the same time warn Ralph of their presence, the
negro had crept around to the top of the cliff, and at the
instant Willis called out he dropped one end of the rope,
and as it fell plump on Ralph’s head, he had his friend’s command
forcibly and instantly impressed upon his mind, and
seizing hold of the rope he was drawn up to the top of the
cliff&mdash;saved.</p>

<p>Without loss of time they hurried from the place, and two
hours’ travel brought them to the mouth of a large cave, where
they at once concluded to spend the night.</p>

<p>They ventured to strike a fire now, for they were wet and
chilly with the heavy dew. They were just within the mouth
of the cavern, and as the fire lighted up the surrounding gloom
it revealed the dark opening back into the hill.</p>

<p>Ralph and Willis at once determined to explore the cavern.
Ebony remonstrated, but as he could give no reason for his
objections, the young adventurers procured a torch and set
out, leaving the negro to stand guard at the entrance.</p>

<p>Led on by the increasing wonders and magnificence of the
place, they threaded the winding passage for several hundred
feet, when they emerged into a wide, capacious chamber.</p>

<p>Here they halted and held the torch above their heads.</p>

<p>“Hist! didn’t you hear footsteps?” exclaimed Willis, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Fudge! no; you’re getting nervous,” returned Ralph, “and<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
imagine you hear the footsteps of ghosts. Come, let us look
further, old boy. No superstition&mdash;Heavens!”</p>

<p>The last exclamation was caused by a sound in the narrow
passage resembling the rolling of a heavy body on trucks. It
came from the passage behind them, and filled with no little
fear and curiosity, they turned and began to retrace their
footsteps.</p>

<p>They had gone but a few steps when they heard the hollow,
rumbling noise again, and what was their surprise and
horror to see an immense rock slide out from the great wall
and completely block their passage.</p>

<p>Ralph raised the torch above his head and turned to Willis,
speechless with terror.</p>

<p>At that instant a wild, demoniac laugh of triumph, that
seemed to issue from the lips of a legion of fiends, greeted the
young men’s ears as it echoed through the hollow chambers
of the cavern.</p>

<p><em>They were entrapped in the den of mountain robbers!</em></p>

<p>In the meanwhile Ebony Jim, hearing the yells of laughter
proceeding from the interior, quickly divined the cause, and
knowing that he could be of no assistance to the young men,
dashed off at a great speed into the forest.</p>

<p>For several hours he pursued his way, his intention being to
hunt up Flick O’Flynn, and daylight found him many miles
from the robber’s cave.</p>

<p>He had begun to feel satisfied that he had escaped his
white enemies when, as he was passing through a narrow defile,
his ear caught the sound of footsteps, and the next instant
he saw three dark figures coming directly toward him.</p>

<p>Quick as thought he swung himself upward into the
branches of a thick tree, and lying at length upon a large limb,
he anxiously awaited the approach of the party.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“SOLOMON STRANGE, MY LORD.”</span></h2>


<p>Two days Silvia had passed in the ranger’s home. Two
days the ranger had spent in fruitless search of her father
among the wilds of the Black Hills. But the kind-hearted
man had every reason to believe that he would yet find him,
and encouraged the maiden’s impatient spirits by the tenderest
words of hope.</p>

<p>With his eagle he had left the cavern in the morning, and
after a hard day’s ride returned at night.</p>

<p>The third day Rainbolt set out upon his mission, in which
he had begun to feel a strange interest.</p>

<p>It was toward noon, that, while ascending a steep hill, he
came suddenly face to face with a strange-looking individual
who had come from the other side of the ridge.</p>

<p>The stranger stopped directly in front of the ranger as if
he were going to dispute his passage. Rainbolt drew rein and
scanned the fellow from head to foot.</p>

<p>He was tall, standing fully six feet in his moccasins, with
an ungainly form, and eyes whose color could not be defined in
the shadow of their scraggy, beetling brows. The complexion
of his face was a dirty sallow, though it was almost hidden
beneath its growth of grizzly gray whiskers that reached to
the man’s waist.</p>

<p>Altogether he was a wretched specimen of humanity, and
Rainbolt could not suppress a smile as he took in his doleful
figure.</p>

<p>The strange creature carried a huge knotted club, with which
he menaced the ranger.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked the fierce-looking man,
abruptly.</p>

<p>“My name is Rodger Rainbolt&mdash;who are you?”</p>

<p>“Solomon Strange, my lord,” the man replied, boastfully.
“I am just from ‘Merry England’ across the water, the
water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“A foreigner,” replied the ranger; “and what brings you
here, Mr. Strange?”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! my lord,” he laughed, with an imbecile
leer; “a love for the chase brings me here. In Merry England
across the water, I was game-keeper to Oliver Cromwell.
Do you know you look so much like my lord Oliver, that I
can’t help calling you my lord? Surely, you are some relation
to him, to him, my lord.”</p>

<p>“None at all,” replied the ranger, much amused; “but you
are an aged man to have lived in Cromwell’s time.”</p>

<p>“So I am, so I am, my lord; but the swiftest that ever
came from the land of the Orient&mdash;the swiftest of all save
your half-brother the Lightning’s bolt.”</p>

<p>“Crazy,” muttered the scout, to himself, “crazy as a loon.”
Then he said aloud:</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful man, Solomon Strange.”</p>

<p>“So I am, so I am, my lord Oliver&mdash;Thunderbolt, I mean;
and I can read the past and future to you, my lord, like an
open book, an open book.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you can tell me where those are I seek?”
said the ranger, humoring his crazy whims.</p>

<p>“<em>Those</em> are I seek,” the man repeated; “yes, yes, yes; there
are five of them, but you need not hunt, my lord. One of
them lies dead and buried where you last saw him, and the
others are scattered through the mountains.”</p>

<p>The ranger would have been surprised had he known how
truthfully the man had spoken, whether gifted with the power
of second sight or not.</p>

<p>Solomon Strange was silent for a moment, then he continued:</p>

<p>“I see you doubt my words, my lord, for you do not know
whether I speak the truth or not; but, try me&mdash;ask me other
questions&mdash;such as you will know whether I answer truthfully,
truthfully, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me for what I seek those persons, or something
touching my past.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you something of both, of both, my lord,” said
the man, closing his sunken eyes and grasping the knotted
staff in both hands.</p>

<p>“In the first question I see a beautiful girl, with golden<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
ringlets and soft blue eyes. Ay, do I not, my lord, do I
not?”</p>

<p>The ranger started with surprise. Before he could speak,
Strange continued:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is so, my lord; I see the answer upon your
flushed face; and now your past, your past, my lord. Ay, it
is gloomy, gloomy. I see trouble and sorrow in the ‘crow’s
feet’ about your eyes, your eyes, do I not?”</p>

<p>“Never mind; go on, go on,” replied the ranger, with a
strange curiosity.</p>

<p>Strange continued:</p>

<p>“Yes, trouble and sorrow in the crow’s feet, and what beyond?
Ay, a group of men, a military tribunal, a cashiered
captain, and who is that wending his way through the hills,
the hills? Now, now I see, my lord; it is the captain, the
cashiered captain; and now, what do I see, see emerge from
the woods and seize the captain. Ay, it’s a legion of dusky
fiends, fiends, and then, oh, then, what beyond that, my lord?
A canoe, a canoe drifting, drifting down a wild mountain
stream, and in it lies the cashiered captain bound hand and
foot, and the canoe with the captain is drifting, drifting toward
what? Ay, toward <em>death</em>&mdash;the falls, the falls&mdash;Oh,
God! he has gone over, and all beyond is black, black as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man’s words were here cut short by a bullet whizzing
in close proximity to his head, closely followed by the report
of a rifle. Throwing up his hands, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Away, Rainbolt! away! the fiends, the fiends are after
you again. Save yourself for the girl’s sake!” and turning,
the man glided away into the forest.</p>

<p>At this instant, Echo, the eagle, appeared over his master’s
head, and uttered a wild scream which the ranger knew to be
his signal of approaching danger, and speaking to his animal,
he dashed away down the stony hill with a score of mounted
Cheyennes thundering after him.</p>

<p>The ranger shaped his course back toward his hidden home,
for the language of the madman, Solomon Strange, had so
fearfully impressed his mind that he could not pursue the
search for Silvia’s father until he had had time for reflection.</p>

<p>After an hour’s hard riding he entered a level, wooded valley,
through which wound the waters of Lodge Pole creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>He now reined his noble animal to a walk, inasmuch as
he had distanced his pursuers, but, suddenly, his eagle again
came swooping down with the warning cry of danger, and
again he rode on at the top of his animal’s speed.</p>

<p>He had gone thus some two miles, when he suddenly
dashed from the thick timbers into an open plain, and what
was his surprise to find himself in the outskirt of an Indian
village.</p>

<p>It required but a single glance to see that the Indians were
Cheyennes, and great was his surprise to see Black Bear among
them.</p>

<p>The ranger’s situation was precarious. He could not turn
back without running into the power of those he was fleeing
from; nor could he turn to the right nor the left on account
of the, almost, perpendicular hills on one side and the creek
on the other. So there was no alternative but to ride directly
through the heart of the village, and drawing his saber and
giving his animal the reins, he dashed on.</p>

<p>He was half-way through the village ere the savages discovered
the daring ranger in their midst, and was gone like
the wind, before they had recovered sufficiently to pursue.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A MIDNIGHT BURIAL.</span></h2>


<p>Frank and Walter’s captors advanced toward the canoe
in which Flick O’Flynn sat, and great was the Irishman’s relief
when he saw that they did not penetrate his disguise.</p>

<p>For several moments the deaf and dumb Indian capered
around the two young men, hoping to give them a signal, but
unfortunately for him, in cutting these pranks, Walter gave
him a kick in the stomach that fairly doubled him on the
beach.</p>

<p>Presently one of the savages motioned for his supposed
deaf and dumb comrade to take a seat in the stern of the
canoe, which he accordingly did with a jump.</p>

<p>The captives were then placed on the seat next to him,<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
facing the same way. Two of the savages with tomahawks
seated themselves facing the captives, while the other two took
up the paddles.</p>

<p>“Holy Vargin!” muttered the Irishman to himself, as the
canoe shot out, “what if wees overtake the canoe with the
rhale Mr. Lo into it? I niver thought of that&mdash;wirra!”</p>

<p>And this they were quite likely to do, for they moved rapidly
down the stream; however, Flick O’Flynn was not long
in making mental preparations for the emergency that was
sure to come, and which did come sooner than he thought for.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the canoe rounded an abrupt bend
in the stream, and but a few rods in advance of them Flick
saw the Indian that he had sent adrift sitting up in the canoe
and gesticulating in an excited manner with one hand, while
with the other he was trying to paddle the little craft up the
stream. Quick as a flash Flick arose to his feet and pointed
in an excited manner toward the savage. The two guards
turned quickly around to see what the mute wished to call
their attention to; and at that instant the Irishman drew his
shillalah from under his coat, and, reaching forward over the
captives’ heads, dealt the savages a blow on the head that
sent them heels over head into the Medicine Bow. And then
he uttered a yell, and springing over the captives’ heads, served
the two oarsmen a blow on the head that caused them to release
their hold on the oars and sink down quietly and unconscious
at his feet.</p>

<p>“Ay, now,” exclaimed the supposed mute Indian, turning to
the wondering captives; “it was a lick on the head wid me
shillalah that made mees known to the rhed bla’guards,
and shill mees make meeself known to yees <em>blind</em> jackasses
the same?”</p>

<p>“Flick, as I’m a confounded fool!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>“And it’s a purty mess yees hev got into,” said the Irishman,
cutting their bonds.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the real mute Indian had succeeded in
reaching the shore and making his escape.</p>

<p>Flick now pitched the two unconscious oarsman out into
the water, and taking the paddle sent the craft flying down
the stream.</p>

<p>In a few minutes an island densely covered with timber was<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
reached and the party landed and drew the canoe up on the
beach.</p>

<p>The trio did not strike a fire for fear of attracting the attention
of the Indians, should any be lurking in the vicinity;
and so they were compelled to go without supper.</p>

<p>Seating themselves in the shadow of the undergrowth,
where they could not be seen, they entered into conversation,
but this was soon interrupted by the sound of paddles.</p>

<p>Rising to their feet and looking up-stream, they discovered a
canoe containing four men coming down toward the island.</p>

<p>They listened and discovered they were whites, but not
feeling free to make known their presence until they ascertained
whether they were friends or foes, or whether they
were going to land on the island or not, they took their
weapons and climbed up a large tree that stood in the center
of the island and concealed themselves among the thick
boughs where they could command a view of the canoe and
its occupants.</p>

<p>The canoe landed in a few moments, and then came an exclamation:</p>

<p>“Hullo, boys! here’s a canoe, and what if sum ’un is onter
the island?”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” exclaimed another, in a tone of fear, “s’pose
you go look ’round an’ see.”</p>

<p>“S’pose you go to the devil, Phil Graball!” replied the
first speaker; “do you think thet Eebenezer Frogfoot’s
goin’ to be a fool and venter out thar alone and git my carcass
riddled with bullets? No, sir-ee, you can’t come thet game.”</p>

<p>“Ye would if ye wer’n’t a coward,” returned Graball.</p>

<p>“Humph! I’ll bet all the gold in the&mdash;the hills thet
you’re afeard ter walk ’round this ’ere island onc’t,” said the
important Ebenezer Frogfoot.</p>

<p>“Ay, now,” whispered Flick O’Flynn, “they’re robbers as
mees is a born Irishman.”</p>

<p>“And cowards, too,” added Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes, but keep still; they may do or say something to our
benefit,” said Frank.</p>

<p>And so they listened and watched.</p>

<p>The matter of scouting the island was finally settled by all
agreeing to go in a body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>So the four brave men got themselves into line and began
beating around through the brush, but they found nothing.</p>

<p>“No one here, thank fortune,” said one of the robbers;
“that canoe has drifted there sometime ’r other.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s bring it ashore,” said another, whereupon they
all returned to the canoe.</p>

<p>One of their number now lit a lantern, which sent a red
beam of light across the island. Two of the men then took
up a dark object from the canoe, and following the one with
the lantern, advanced toward the interior of the island.</p>

<p>“Here’s the spot,” said the robber with the light, stopping
directly under the tree in which our friends were ensconced.</p>

<p>The two with the burden advanced and placed it on the
ground at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>Our friends started with a shudder at what they saw.</p>

<p><em>It was a beautiful, silver-mounted coffin!</em></p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A MEETING AT THE DEVIL’S TARN.</span></h2>


<p>The Devil’s Tarn and the Crystal Falls were one and the
same. The latter name had been given the torrent of Rodger
Rainbolt, who, as the reader already knows, dwelt in the
secret cavern whose entrance was concealed by the falls. To
those dwelling in the mountains&mdash;the hunters, robbers, and
Indians, the place was known as the Devil’s Tarn, and by this
name we will call it hereafter.</p>

<p>It was about two hours of midnight on the evening of the
same day that Rodger Rainbolt had unexpectedly rode into
the Indian encampment on Lodge Pole, that the figure of a
man wrapped in a kind of military cloak, and wearing a
broad-brimmed hat and pair of high-topped boots, and carrying
a bull’s-eye lantern, might have been seen pacing to and
fro beneath the boughs of a great pine tree that stood but a
few feet from the head of the Devil’s Tarn.</p>

<p>Presently, his keen ear caught the soft tread of moccassined<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
feet, and the next moment a dark hairy figure emerged
from the black wood and advanced toward him. The man
lifted his lantern and flashed it upon the figure of the new-comer.</p>

<p>It was Black Bear, the Cheyenne chief. And the man who
held the lantern was Duval Dungarvon, the robber-captain.</p>

<p>“Ay, Duval Dungarvon, and so you’re on time,” said the
chief, seizing the robber by the hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, my handsome Black Bear, I am always up to time;
but where’s the girl?” replied Dungarvon.</p>

<p>“Gone to the devil,” bluntly replied Black Bear.</p>

<p>“Come now, don’t trifle with me, Blufe Brandon!” exclaimed
the robber-captain, fiercely. “I ask you where the
girl is?”</p>

<p>“And I tell you she’s gone to the devil,” returned the
chief.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Brandon?”</p>

<p>“Simply what I say; that infernal white ranger known
as Rainbolt, rode right into camp&mdash;picked up your girl,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And what?” gasped the robber-captain with impatient
rage and fury.</p>

<p>“And went&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;devil with her, as I told you before,”
returned, with emphasis, the chief.</p>

<p>The robber-captain ground his teeth with rage, stamped
his foot with fury, and swore a terrible oath.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Dungarvon! I am going&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” returned Dungarvon, savagely, “you’re always
going to do something. Just like as any way, the girl’s in
California by this time.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, Captain Duval,” returned Black Bear;
“that girl is in these ‘Hills,’ and wherever Rainbolt is,
she is, also; and I know he is not far away.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because he rode right through the heart of our encampment
to-day, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And escaped?”</p>

<p>“Yes, escaped.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! ha!” laughed the robber-captain, his voice
ringing out above the roar of the Devil’s Tarn; “well, that<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
beats any thing on record. But, do you know who that ranger
is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your rival for the hand of Silvia Sanford.”</p>

<p>“Curse you, Brandon; if it wasn’t for one thing I’d shoot
you for your insolence.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, and it wouldn’t be the first man you’d
shot, either,” returned Black Bear.</p>

<p>“Well, well, let’s talk business, Black Bear. I’m bound
to have that girl if I have to wade through fire and brimstone.”</p>

<p>“Whew, captain! but you’re desperately in love!”</p>

<p>“In love!” sneered the captain; “humph! all I want the
girl for is to torture Sanford, for I know he worships her like
I did the dark-eyed Inez, her mother. He cheated me out of
the other girl, and I’ll be hanged if he does this one. But if
he could jist get a hold on old Barker he’d be all right; but
I’ll see to Barker. For two years he has lain in prison up at
my ranch, and seems as though he never will die. He’s nothing
but a living skeleton now, and if I wasn’t afraid of
needing him some time I’d tumble him into the Dead Gorge.
But to business. Now, if you will hunt up and deliver into
my hands, at my ranch, within the next week, Silvia Sanford,
I will add five thousand more to what I offered you at Omaha.
What say you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, if it costs me every brave in my tribe,” replied
Black Bear, excited at the liberal reward of his friend.</p>

<p>“And there is another thing, Brandon,” said the robber-chief;
“I was thinking that, if you were one of my band, as
well as an Indian chief, we could throw our forces together
and work to a better advantage.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve been thinkin’ that I would like to join your order
if it wasn’t for your confounded initiatory ceremony.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit it does make a fellow a little shaky in the joints,”
said Dungarvon; “but I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you will
meet me to-morrow noon at the Lone Pine, I’ll give a synopsis
of the ‘ceremony,’ that you will not be unnerved in case you
will join us.”</p>

<p>“<em>I’ll do it!</em>” returned the renegade, emphatically; “to-morrow
noon at Lone Pine, and I’ll expect you to tell me the
truth in regard to the ‘ceremony,’ for a nice story it would<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
be to get out, that Black Bear, the great Cheyenne chief, had
shown the white feather at a ceremony!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! Brandon,” laughed Dungarvon; “you are
naturally weak in the joints, but let it be understood&mdash;to-morrow
noon, at Lone Pine.”</p>

<p>“I will not fail you, rest assured,” said Black Bear.</p>

<p>Dungarvon mounted a horse which he had hitched near,
and soon he was thundering away over the stony hills, back
to his den.</p>

<p>Black Bear turned and glided away through the woods toward
his village, and as he did so, a figure&mdash;the figure of a
tall man with long, yellow, disheveled hair streaming behind,
and carrying a heavy club, crept from the bushes within five
feet of where the villains had held their interview, and stole
with the silence of a phantom after the chief, his huge club
upraised to beat him down.</p>

<p>It was Solomon Strange, the madman.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SILVIA’S TROUBLES.</span></h2>


<p>Silvia Sanford did not spend her days of confinement in
the ranger’s home in tears and sorrow. Far from it, though
she felt anxious and uneasy about her father’s safety. She
was perfectly contented in the society of the ranger, and his
books when he was absent. Too, she had spent much of her
time in wandering through the cavern, watching the falls
and the beautiful trout that gamboled through the crystal waters.</p>

<p>It was on the morning following the night of Duval Dungarvon
and Black Bear’s meeting, that the falls were parted
a short time after sunrise, and a canoe, in which were the
ranger and Silvia, and Echo, the eagle, shot out from under
the falls and landed on the left bank of the stream.</p>

<p>The ranger took Silvia by the hand and assisted her on
shore, and then led her up the steep, rocky cliff onto the summit<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
of a high ridge overlooking the little valley below, and
the distant hills.</p>

<p>He seated himself on a large rock and drew the maiden
down by his side.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Sanford,” he said, waving his hand away before
him, “you can have a fair view of nature in her fresh morning
robes.”</p>

<p>Silvia’s eyes took in the landscape before her.</p>

<p>“Oh, how grand and beautiful, Mr. Rainbolt!” she murmured,
softly.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking, Silvia, that if we could always gaze
upon the beauties of nature, and enjoy them together as we
have this morning, what bliss would be ours.”</p>

<p>Silvia’s face flushed, and her heart fluttered wildly and yet
strangely to her. With a tremulous voice she replied:</p>

<p>“That could never be, Rodger.”</p>

<p>“And why not? There is nothing impossible, Silvia.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then pardon me, Silvia, for speaking plainly what my
heart compels me to say,” he said, in a warm, tender voice.
“Since I have met you, I have learned to love you, as only a
true heart can love. Forgive me, Silvia, but I could not keep
back this confession, and I pray you will not feel insulted, or
as though I were taking advantage of your helplessness. God
forbid.”</p>

<p>The maiden’s eyes sought the ground shyly. Her heart
leaped with strange emotion, but, after a few moments’ silence,
during which the warm color in her cheeks came and went,
she looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Why need I disguise my feelings? Oh, Rodger, my heart
tells me I love you; but, give me one day to answer your
question, to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Silvia, a week, a year, since I have heard from
your lips that I am loved!” replied the handsome ranger, his
face radiant with joy.</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence, broken only by the roar
of the falls. The ranger was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Since my heart feels lighter, dear Silvia, since I have
something left in the world to hope for now, I feel like another
man, yet I am neglecting my duty to you, and so I must<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
leave you now, and go and continue the search for your
father. Shall I accompany you into the cavern before I
go?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Rodger, I will remain here awhile in the cheerful
sunshine, then I can go down into the cavern alone. Go, and
may God speed you,” she replied.</p>

<p>The ranger imprinted a warm and ardent kiss upon her
brow, then turned, and with Echo perched upon his shoulder,
went in search of his pony.</p>

<p>Silvia watched him until he had disappeared; then she
seated herself again, and became absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>How long she had remained so she did not know, but presently
a soft footstep aroused her from her abstraction.</p>

<p>She arose to her feet and turned quickly around. An Indian
woman, whom she at once recognized as Silver Voice,
stood before her. Silvia was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, Silver Voice! it is you, who were so kind to me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear girl,” the woman replied, with much sadness in
her voice, “but you are looking happier than when I last saw
you.”</p>

<p>“Really, Silver Voice, I should be miserable indeed if I
had not found a friend,” returned Silvia.</p>

<p>“Ah! dear girl, I know why. You have learned to love
your handsome rescuer and friend, the ranger, and he loves
you. Forgive me, but I stood in that shrubbery and heard
his avowal of love and your reply.”</p>

<p>Silvia’s face flushed with anger.</p>

<p>“Do not get angry,” Silver Voice continued, “for it is all
for your own good. Let me tell you, that if ever you marry
Rodger Rainbolt, you will rue it to the bitter end.”</p>

<p>“Silver Voice!” cried Silvia, petulantly, “why do you presume
to speak so prophetic? You astound me!”</p>

<p>“I know I do, but I speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“What do you know of Mr. Rainbolt, Silver Voice?”</p>

<p>“I know much&mdash;oh, God! <em>much!</em>” she cried, in a tone of
sudden agony.</p>

<p>“And <em>how</em> do you know it?” questioned Silvia, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Take <em>that</em>,” Silver Voice said, handing Silvia a folded paper,
“and when I am gone, read it. It will tell you all you
wish to know of Rodger Rainbolt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>“And of you?” questioned Silvia, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No. You do not wish, you do not <em>need</em> to know more of
me than you do; but promise me that you will not breathe
one word in the paper to the ranger.”</p>

<p>“I promise you,” said Silvia, scarcely knowing what she
was saying.</p>

<p>“Then, good-by; you may never see me again,” said Silver
Voice, and turning, she vanished in the forest like a shadow.</p>

<p>“Strange, mysterious woman,” muttered Silvia; “she seems
like the vision of a dream to me. But the paper.”</p>

<p>She opened it. One side was blank, the other covered
with the delicate handwriting of a female.</p>

<p>Silvia’s face turned ghastly pale as she glanced at the first
words, and by the time she had finished the first line, her
whole frame was trembling violently. But she read on, read
on to the end, and then she uttered a low, convulsive cry,
and wrung her hands as though a terrible agony was breaking
her heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” she exclaimed. “Is it possible?”</p>

<p>With her feelings wrought to the highest pitch of excitement,
she descended the cliff to the water’s edge, and stepped
into the canoe to return to the cavern.</p>

<p>As she did so, she did not notice that round, dark ball
from which shone a pair of burning orbs, resting on the water,
yet concealed under the projecting rim of the canoe; nor
did she observe how the craft dragged as it entered beneath
the waters when they were parted, with a deadly enemy clinging
to its side.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MEANING OF THE COFFIN.</span></h2>


<p>Frank Armond and Walter Lyman felt a chill pass over
their frames as they gazed down upon the coffin and the four
burly, rough-looking men standing around it.</p>

<p>The Irishman acted quite easy and indifferent about the
matter, as he did on all occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>The coffin was small; about the size that a ten-year-old
child would require.</p>

<p>For a moment the robbers gazed at it, then one of them
asked:</p>

<p>“Do ye s’pose the body’s all right into it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” was the response. “It mout hev got shook
around; however, it won’t take long ter look,” and in a few
moments the lid was removed.</p>

<p>The lantern was lowered as the four men bent over the
coffin, and our friends in the tree parted the foliage carefully,
and peered down, eager to get a glimpse of the dead.</p>

<p>And true enough they did. The pale waxen face of a
beautiful child, wrapped in a sheet was revealed to their
startled gaze.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” growled one of the robbers.</p>

<p>“Ya-as, put on the lid, and let’s git it sunk quick as possible.”</p>

<p>While the robber with the knife was screwing on the lid
of the coffin, one of the others went to the canoe and brought
a shovel, with which he at once began digging a grave.</p>

<p>In a few moments a grave had been dug some three feet
deep, and the coffin placed therein, and then covered up&mdash;the
sods and turfs of grass being replaced so as to conceal every
trace of the ground having been disturbed.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed one of the robbers, when their
task was finished; “the duty o’ the livin’ to the dead is
done.”</p>

<p>At that instant a wild scream was heard overhead, and
looking up the robbers, as well as our friends in the tree, beheld
that horrible, mysterious creature&mdash;the Aërial Demon&mdash;float
over the island and disappear down the stream.</p>

<p>It acted like a charm on the rebellious robbers, for they
rushed to their canoe, and in a moment were flying upon the
stream, fearing to speak above a whisper.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of sight our friends descended
from the tree.</p>

<p>“Ay, now, and it’s a lovely set of critters they ware,” said
the Irishman; “and it’s mees thet’ll dig up the coffin as
soon as daylight comes and look into the mather a leetle so I
will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sure we have seen all that’s to be seen,” said Walter,
“and so let the dead rest.”</p>

<p>“There, now, and it’s yees thet know little av the bloody
robber deviltry. There’s a thrick in it, now mind.”</p>

<p>As the night was quite warm, Walter and Frank laid
down upon the ground and soon fell asleep, leaving Flick on
guard.</p>

<p>When they awoke in the morning the sun was up, and the
first thing they saw was Flick O’Flynn just lifting the coffin
out the grave.</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose you are satisfied now you’ve dug up
the body,” said Walter, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>“Nary bit av it, Mishter Walter, I haven’t see’d inside yet,”
said the Irishman, as he began to unscrew the lid.</p>

<p>Walter and Frank came and stood by and watched him
perform the operation with no little curiosity. The last screw
removed, the lid was lifted and&mdash;</p>

<p>There was the pale waxen face of the dead upturned to
the clear morning sun, with the flaxen-white hair clustered
about the face.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are satisfied now,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Flick burst into a loud laugh and replied:</p>

<p>“Ay, and it’s blind yees are. Can’t yees see the thrick?”</p>

<p>“<em>Trick?</em> no; what do you mean, O’Flynn?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em>, now!” replied the Irishman, and he clutched his
fingers in the silken hair of the corpse and held up to the
astonished gaze of the young men the <em>trunkless head</em> of a <span class="smcap">WAX-FIGURE</span>!</p>

<p>He now laid down the waxen head and proceeded to unroll
what appeared the body wrapped in a white sheet. Fold
after fold was unrolled, until finally, a small leather bag, filled
with some hard metal rolled out. Flick seized the bag, and
taking up his knife cut it open, and then turning it up he
poured into the coffin a great heap of <em>gold coin</em>.</p>

<p>“Thet’s the body,” said Flick, a grin of triumph overspreading
his broad, florid face.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes,” replied Frank, “and a clever trick it is.
But why do they take so much trouble in burying their gold?”</p>

<p>“Thinking, thet if any greenhorn like yeeselfs should rhun
ag’inst the coffin and open it, see the dead face, or wax figure<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
in’t, they would misthrust nothing&mdash;put it back and go
their way, jist as yees would have done in this case.”</p>

<p>Flick now filled the leather bag with pebbles, wrapped it
in the old ragged clothes taken from the mute half-breed, and
stuffed it back into the coffin with the wax-figure. He then
consigned the coffin to the earth again&mdash;covered it over and
smoothed down the sods.</p>

<p>The three pocketed their gold, the generous Irishman having
insisted on dividing it equally, which proved no little incumbrance
as well as fortune, and taking up their arms crossed
over to the main-land.</p>

<p>By this time long fasting was beginning to tell upon their
strength, and it was at once decided to procure something to
appease their gnawing hunger.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ hunting resulted in Flick shooting a fawn,
a portion of which was at once roasted. After the meal had
been dispatched, another slice of meat was cooked and stowed
away in the young sportsmen’s game-bags for future use.</p>

<p>Feeling much refreshed they now continued their journey
through the hills, and ere long discovered an Indian trail.</p>

<p>The party at once set off to follow it, and pursued rapidly
until it entered a deep, black defile, where the growth of heavy
pines almost excluded the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>“Faith, and it’s not the farst thime thet mees hev been
through here,” said Flick; “and every time I could imagine
thet mees felt the icy fingers av Old Nick upon me.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the last word left his lips, than a huge, dusky
hand was thrust down from among the foliage of the low,
drooping boughs under which he was passing&mdash;clutched him
with its cold, bony fingers by the nape of the neck, and drew
him from the ground, up among the dark boughs with the
quickness of a flash.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE TRAGEDY IN THE FOREST GLADE.</span></h2>


<p>Like a phantom the tall form of Solomon Strange glided
through the forest after Black Bear.</p>

<p>Now and then the renegade would stop and gaze around
him as though he felt a presentiment of lurking danger, and
then again move on.</p>

<p>Half a mile from the Indian encampment was a little glade
through which ran the trail the chief was following. As he
neared the edge of it, the madman quickened his pace, and
just as the renegade stepped into the moonlit space, a wild
voice called out:</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>The renegade involuntarily stopped and turned around.</p>

<p>At this moment the tall form of Solomon Strange sprung
from the forest shadows, and dealt the chief a blow with his
club that felled him lifeless at his feet.</p>

<p>Bending over the prostrate form, he scrutinized it.</p>

<p>“Yes, life is extinct,” muttered he, and dropping upon his
knees he began removing the bear’s skin from his body. This
done, a low, triumphant laugh escaped Solomon Strange’s lips,
and he lifted the lifeless form in his arms, and carried it a
short ways into the woods and hurled it down into a deep,
black gorge.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, a dark, hairy form appeared in the glade.
It was the form of Solomon Strange disguised in the bear’s
skin.</p>

<p>No one could have told him from Blufe Brandon. Their
movements were similar, and their size exactly the same.</p>

<p>“So far I have been successful,” he murmured. “I stand
in Black Bear’s disguise; and now if I can only have the nerve
and cunning to occupy his position among the red-skins for a
few days, I will make these old hills stand aghast with wonder
and startling revelations. The Cheyenne tongue I can handle
to a demonstration, and I believe I can imitate Black Bear’s
voice exactly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>“And then, there’s Duval Dungarvon; but I can hoodwink
him easy enough. Yes, to-morrow noon I will meet him at
the Lone Pine, get a synopsis of the ‘initiatory ceremony’ into
the order of road-agents and cut-throats. Ah, Solomon Strange!
a desperate game is yours, and for what?&mdash;to solve a dark
mystery, and rub out the stains of a dark crime that lays concealed
behind it, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>His musings were here brought to an abrupt termination,
by suddenly entering the opening in which stood the Indian
encampment, while a few paces off sat an Indian sentinel.</p>

<p>“Will he challenge me?” the false chief mentally asked.</p>

<p>Then he knew that the sentinel would see that it was Black
Bear’s disguise, and allow him to pass. And so he did, with
only a low, guttural exclamation at sight of the great chief.</p>

<p>As Strange entered the outskirts of the village, he saw that
a large fire was burning in front of the council-lodge, and that
a number of warriors were singing and dancing around it.</p>

<p>“I’ll swow,” muttered Strange, “I’m going to be drawn
right into business, the first thing. I’d rather kept a little to
myself a day or so, until I got the exact run of things&mdash;heavens!”</p>

<p>As if to favor his wish, at this moment a wild scream was
heard overhead, and lifting his eyes, the mysterious Solomon
Strange beheld the Aërial Demon floating over the village; so
horrifying in its appearance that his blood seemed turned to ice.</p>

<p>Had a bomb-shell exploded in the midst of the exultant
warriors that were dancing around the council-fire, they would
not have scattered and fled in greater fear and terror.</p>

<p>The moment that the false Black Bear saw the young warriors
flee with terror to their respective lodges, he hurried across
the square and entered the lodge to the right of the council-house,
which he knew to be the renegade’s.</p>

<p>All was dark within this lodge, so Strange went and procured
a torch from the deserted council-fire. With it, he
rummaged the room, making himself acquainted with every
thing, nook and corner within it.</p>

<p>He then extinguished the torch, threw himself upon a couch
of skins in one corner, and curious to say, this mysterious madman,
who after all was <em>not</em> a madman, fell asleep and slept
soundly until morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>He was awakened by the sound of voices without, and rising
from his couch he peered out.</p>

<p>At this moment a light footstep was heard approaching.
The skin hanging at the door of his lodge was raised, and a
beautiful Indian woman entered, carrying upon a tray of woven
rushes some slices of venison and roasted fish.</p>

<p>It was the wife of Allacotah, Silver Voice!</p>

<p>Solomon Strange started like a wild man at sight of the
woman, but she failed to notice it.</p>

<p>“The chief of the Cheyennes must be hungry, since he had
no supper,” said Silver Voice, handing him the venison and
fish.</p>

<p>Again Solomon Strange started&mdash;this time at sound of the
woman’s voice, though his disguise concealed his emotion.
As he took the provision, however, Silver Voice caught sight
of his eyes that glowed like burning coals of fire through
the hairy mask, and caused a strange feeling to pervade her
breast.</p>

<p>“Yes, Black Bear is quite hungry,” Strange replied, watching
to see if his voice attracted her notice.</p>

<p>It did. The woman started and turned to flee with sudden
fear.</p>

<p>“<em>You are not Blufe Brandon!</em>” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Solomon Strange seized her by the arm and prevented her
escape. Then he stooped and whispered something in her
ear. She would have involuntarily screamed, but Strange
placed his claw-clad hand over her mouth and prevented her.</p>

<p>“Hush! for God’s sake!” he exclaimed in an undertone,
“do not expose me, but help me.”</p>

<p>Here was more mystery. What could this strange, wild
man be to Silver Voice? And what she, to him? And why
did he have the power to hold her spell-bound&mdash;speechless?
Alas! why, and for what?</p>

<p>For fully ten minutes Silver Voice remained in the lodge
with the false chief, in a low and earnest conversation. Then
she went out and returned to her own lodge to the left of the
council-lodge.</p>

<p>Presently, her husband, Allacotah, entered Black Bear’s
tent. He found the supposed great chief lying upon the
couch of skins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“Is the great Black Bear unwell?” asked the young chief.</p>

<p>“He is,” returned Solomon Strange, hoarsely; “exposure
to the night air is fast telling upon the Black Bear’s lungs.
It hurts him to speak. He is hoarse, but he wished to speak
to the brave young chief, Allacotah.”</p>

<p>“The ears of Allacotah are open,” returned the young chief,
“he harkens to the voice of the great Black Bear.”</p>

<p>“Since I am unable to take the war-path,” began Solomon
Strange, his hoarseness seeming to grow worse each moment,
“I want the brave young Allacotah to take all my
warriors and go away in the hills toward the rising sun and
search for the white maiden. Should you find her, harm not
a hair of her head, or the vengeance of the great Manitou
will rest upon you. Should you find <em>any</em> pale-faces, harm
them not, but bring them before Black Bear, even the great
White Ranger whose sword has slain our braves in the heart
of our encampment. Black Bear has spoken.”</p>

<p>“Allacotah has heard, and will do his bidding with joy
and pride,” returned Allacotah, “but he is sorry the great
chief is unwell, and can not lead his warriors upon the trail.
But he must rest and he will be well soon. Allacotah has
spoken.”</p>

<p>The young chief turned and left the tent, and in a few
moments the wildest excitement prevailed throughout the
village. Laughing to himself at his novel situation and splendid
success, Solomon Strange peered out at a hole in his
lodge, and saw that Allacotah was gathering his warriors for
the war-path.</p>

<p>In less than an hour every warrior able to bear arms had
left the village.</p>

<p>Black Bear, or Solomon Strange, now arose and walked
away through the encampment and plunged into the woods.</p>

<p>He was on his way to Lone Pine to meet Duval Dungarvon.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SILVIA’S PERILS.</span></h2>


<p>Silvia paddled the canoe, with the Cheyenne concealed
under its projecting rim, under the falls; and having landed,
she raised the sweep to let the waters close, then she took
the lamp from where the ranger had left it in a niche, and
wended her way back to her apartment, seated herself and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>The discovery that she had made had sorely wounded her
young, loving heart, and left her confused mind wrapped in
blind mystery.</p>

<p>Purle, the panther, was crouched at her feet, and as her
eyes sought the floor, the animal started up, his ears laid
back like those of a maddened cat, his tail moving slowly
from side to side, and his eyes glaring like coals of fire.</p>

<p>Silvia looked in the direction indicated by his burning gaze,
and to her horror she beheld a Cheyenne Indian gazing in
upon her from the door of the apartment.</p>

<p>Silvia uttered a low sob and fell unconscious to the floor
with affright, the paper falling on the table by the lamp.</p>

<p>The savage, not seeing the panther, advanced into the
room, but the next instant the beast leaped forward and
dragged him to the floor.</p>

<p>A fierce struggle ensued. But it was as brief as decisive.
The panther tore the savage almost into shreds.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a footstep sounded in the rocky hall.
The next moment Rodger Rainbolt entered the room. As
his eyes fell upon the mutilated form of the savage, the
prostrate form of Silvia, the blood upon the panther’s jowls,
the paper upon the table by the lamp, he staggered under
the sight.</p>

<p>Springing forward he raised Silvia tenderly in his arms and
placed her upon the couch in the corner. He then turned to
change the light in a better position, and as he did so the paper
arrested his attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>He glanced at the first word. A cry burst from his lips.
His eyes became fixed upon the paper like one in a trance.
He could not, he did not move them, until he had read the
last word. Then he turned away, his whole frame trembling
violently.</p>

<p>He removed the body of the savage; then, taking a vessel,
hurried down to the falls to bring some cool water with
which to bathe the brow of the maiden.</p>

<p>When he returned he was surprised to find her recovered,
and sitting up on the bed, gazing about in a kind of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Silvia, my darling!” exclaimed the ranger.</p>

<p>She looked around, her senses returning.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rodger!” she exclaimed, springing from the couch
and snatching the paper; “but you must not see it.”</p>

<p>“But I have seen it, Silvia.”</p>

<p>“And read it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rodger! I promised never to breathe a word of it
to you.”</p>

<p>“Promised who?”</p>

<p>“Silver Voice, the Indian woman, the wife of Allacotah.”</p>

<p>“You have kept your promise, Silvia. I saw the paper by
accident.”</p>

<p>“Then you know all, Rodger?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Silvia; but how came you to get the paper from the
Indian woman, and where?”</p>

<p>Silvia told him all.</p>

<p>The ranger sighed painfully. He was silent for a moment,
then said:</p>

<p>“But Silvia, that paper is a falsehood. I will admit that
I have been married to a woman that was an angel, but were
she living I would not be here. No, no, Silvia! God knows
I loved my wife&mdash;yea, adored her, worshiped her; but a cruel
fate separated us; death took my darling wife, and in you,
Silvia, I had hoped to find her equal.”</p>

<p>“But you have no proof, Rodger, to prove to me that
the statement in this paper is untrue&mdash;that your wife is
dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>“I can procure evidence, Silvia, in an hour, yes, in a moment,
to prove to you that my wife is dead. But, tell me, my
dear Silvia, does the handwriting of this note resemble any
person’s handwrite that <em>you</em> know?” and he handed her the
note.</p>

<p>Silvia took the paper and examined the writing closely. A
shade of sadness came over her face, as she replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, Rodger, it resembles my poor sister Florence’s writing
a great deal, though she was a better writer.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a sister?”</p>

<p>“I had, but poor Florence is dead now!”</p>

<p>“Are you <em>certain</em> that she is dead?” the ranger asked.</p>

<p>“Why, Rodger, you are getting excited,” she replied, with
much surprise at the ranger’s question. “Of course I would
not tell you a falsehood about my sister being dead, since it
is nothing to you.”</p>

<p>“But it is something to me, Silvia; it is something to me;
but, let us drop the question, before it gets to be painful. I
must go and search for your father and that Indian woman
who gave you the paper. Have you any fears to remain here
alone?”</p>

<p>“None at all since I have such a noble companion and protector
as Purle, the panther.”</p>

<p>“Then I will take my departure, entertaining hopes that
the mystery that enshrouds us will be cleared away, and that
I may yet insist for an answer to the question of my love for
you,” said the ranger, and as he concluded he turned and left
the maiden alone.</p>

<p>When his footsteps had died away in the distant hall, Silvia
threw herself upon her couch and wept bitterly.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">DUVAL DUNGARVON AND BLACK BEAR AT THE LONE PINE.</span></h2>


<p>The sun had just crossed the meridian, on the day set for
the meeting of Duval Dungarvon and Black Bear at the
Lone Pine, when Solomon Strange, in Black Bear’s disguise,
emerged from the forest on the south side of the glade, and
stopped beneath the Lone Pine.</p>

<p>He had not been there more than an hour when Duval
Dungarvon emerged from the forest on the north side of the
glade and advanced toward him.</p>

<p>“Here we are ag’in,” exclaimed Solomon Strange, quite
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the robber-captain, looking at him in a way
that made Strange flinch with uneasiness; “but what’s the
matter, Brandon, you talk so hoarse?”</p>

<p>“Matter enuff,” returned the false Black Bear. “I catched
a devil of a cold last night at the Devil’s Tarn. But come,
let’s to business.”</p>

<p>“Now, if I tell you, Brandon, you must never breathe it
to a living soul, for it is in strict violation of our laws to do
so.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of me tellin’, Dungarvon. Go on
with your story.”</p>

<p>The robber-captain began, and in a few moments he had
related the whole of their proceedings in initiating a man into
their band of Mountain Men, or robbers, and concluded by
saying:</p>

<p>“Suppose you go in to-night?”</p>

<p>“Can jist as well as not,” replied Strange, “though there
is one thing I had forgotten to mention.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“I shall insist on keeping my bear-skin on at the ranch.”</p>

<p>“Of course! We wouldn’t know that the great <em>Black Bear</em>
was in our midst unless you wore it,” returned Dungarvon.</p>

<p>“Then I am ready to go with you,” said the false chief.</p>

<p>The two arose and at once set off toward the robber’s ranch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>As they walked along, conversing on different topics,
Strange finally said:</p>

<p>“You have never told me, Dungarvon, why it is that you
hate this man Sanford so bitterly.”</p>

<p>“No. I tell <em>very</em> few, because I don’t want everybody to
know, for then it would be no secret, and that’s the beauty of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but tell it, tell it to me, Dungarvon,” said Strange.</p>

<p>“Well, to make a short story out of a long one, Sanford
and I both loved the same woman, a Creole of New Orleans.
She would have married me, but Sanford, curse him! told her
I was the son of an Italian brigand, and so won her. In the
course of time they had two children, Florence and Silvia.
Wayland Sanford went to California during the gold-fever,
and I followed, waiting for a chance to take his life. After a
time the chance came. Sanford quarreled with a miner, and
publicly threatened his life. That night the miner was killed.
Of course <em>I</em> did it, but I was detected in the act by one of
Sanford’s friends. I threw the man down the shaft, and left
him there. Sanford was arrested for the crime, but escaped,
and flew, no one knew where. I followed, but failed to find
my man.</p>

<p>“I left California. And seeing that money could be made,
organized the band I now command, and we have been operating
the route ever since.</p>

<p>“Some time after I began, a regiment of troops came into
the region, and fearing they were after me, I went, in disguise,
to the camp, and sought an interview with the colonel. You
can imagine my surprise when I found myself face to face
with Wayland Sanford, colonel commanding the regiment!</p>

<p>“He knew me, and fearful that I would blow on him, asked
the price of my silence.</p>

<p>“I knew Inez was dead, so I demanded the daughter,
Florence, for my wife. He stormed and swore; offered ten
thousand dollars, but I laughed at him, and to end the matter,
he finally gave in and wrote to his daughter that he had made
an engagement for her hand with a <em>particular</em> friend. The
girl declined the honor, and answered that she was engaged to
an officer in his regiment, one Captain Warren Walraven.</p>

<p>“I told Sanford I could fix <em>him</em>, and so I sat down and wrote
a letter, forged the handwriting, from Walraven to Blufe<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
Brandon, chief of the Cheyennes, in which he offered to sell
the command into his power. This I dropped where one of
Sanford’s scouts found it and gave it to the colonel.</p>

<p>“Walraven was court-martialed and dismissed the service.
The next day he, with his nigger servant, Ebony Jim, started
for Laramie, where Florence was. I captured him on his
way&mdash;the nigger escaped&mdash;and taking him to Devil’s Tarn,
I put him in a canoe and started him adrift over the falls.
That ended <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>“Sanford wrote to his daughter, telling her all about Walraven,
how he was cashiered and killed by the Indians, but
she had suddenly disappeared from the fort, and was seen no
more. Her skeleton, however, was found in an old well near
the fort, a year or so afterward. About a year after that I
entrapped a traveler, who proved to be the very man, Barker,
whom I had thrown down the shaft!”</p>

<p>“And you hold him a prisoner yet?” asked Black Bear.</p>

<p>“You bet, though he can’t last a week longer. A few
weeks since I heard Sanford was at Omaha, and you know the
rest. But here we are at the ranch.”</p>

<p>They stood at the mouth of the cavern wherein Willis and
Ralph had been captured. A sentinel was posted at the entrance,
who demanded the password from Dungarvon before
he was allowed to pass with the supposed Black Bear, it being
so dark by this time that the sentinel could not distinguish
the features of the captain.</p>

<p>Passing along the narrow cavern a short way, the captain
stopped and placed his hand in a small niche in the rocky
wall. Immediately the wall seemed to part with a heavy,
grating noise.</p>

<p>“This way, Brandon,” said the robber chief, and the two
stepped through the aperture in the wall, into a small, but
brilliantly-lighted chamber. Then the captain touched a
small, projecting rock on the wall, when the two walls rolled
together again, and there was no sign of the aperture through
which they had passed.</p>

<p>“This,” said Dungarvon, turning to his companion, “is my
private apartment, and you may now consider yourself, Black
Bear, in the Lodge of Mountain Men, from which you will never
go alive until you have been initiated into the brotherhood.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ADVENTURE IN THE DARK.</span></h2>


<p>Ebony Jim had not remained in his concealment among
the foliage more than a minute when he recognized the voice
of his old friend, Flick O’Flynn, among the three whom he at
first took for robbers, but who in fact were O’Flynn, Frank
Armond and Walter Lyman.</p>

<p>Ebony was in the act of springing to the ground and making
his presence known, when the Irishman’s remark&mdash;which
caught the negro’s ears&mdash;of the place through which they
were passing being so gloomy, and that he imagined he felt
the icy fingers of the Old Nick upon him, suggested a practical
joke to his mind. Waiting until the trio were directly
under him, he thrust his hand down through the foliage, and seizing
the loquacious O’Flynn by the neck, jerked him from
the ground and up among the foliage with the quickness of
thought.</p>

<p>Flick gave vent to a furious yell, and dropping his rifle
drew his knife, supposing that he was in the hands of the
Old Boy, sure enough. But what was his surprise, when, on
turning to deal a deadly blow, he saw Ebony seated before
him, his sable face convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>“Faith, and mees hev a notion to give yees a dig wath
this knife, so I hev; but niver mind, there’s a rheckoning
coming, so there is.”</p>

<p>But how had it fared with Frank and Walter?</p>

<p>They saw the negro’s hand thrust down, saw Flick lifted
from the ground, heard his frightful scream, and, without a
second look or thought, took to their heels and fled with all
possible speed over the hill.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, they ran right from safety into danger.</p>

<p>They had not gone more than a mile when they discovered
a party of mounted Cheyenne charging directly toward them.</p>

<p>Instantly Frank’s rifle was to his face, and he shot, in quick<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
succession, two of the leading savages. He was quickly surrounded
by the whole party, which gave Walter an opportunity
to escape, which he did.</p>

<p>Frank was tied upon one of the ponies, and immediately
the Indians, a score in all, mounted their animals and set off
toward the north, moving in regular Indian file, one after the
other, Frank being next to the foremost one, who <em>led</em> his&mdash;the
captive’s&mdash;pony. They seemed in no hurry, moving along
quite leisurely. However, they failed to discover two figures
that were stealing after them like shadows.</p>

<p>Slowly the day wore away. Night came on. Frank
strained his eyes in hopes of catching a glimpse of some friendly
form moving through the gloom. Suddenly he heard a slight
noise before him. He fixed his eyes on the gloom in advance.
Just then the animal of the preceding and foremost captor flitted
across a patch of moonlight struggling feebly down through
the opening in the tree-tops.</p>

<p>The captive started with wonder and surprise.</p>

<p><em>The animal was riderless!</em></p>

<p>Not one of the savages behind had discovered the sudden,
silent and mysterious disappearance of their leader.</p>

<p>Again the preceding animal crossed a patch of moonlight,
and still greater was his surprise, when he recognized by a
kind of phosphorescent gleam, the form of <em>Flick O’Flynn seated
upon its back</em>!</p>

<p>Then the truth flashed upon his mind. Flick, the brave
and noble hunter, had escaped, followed his, Frank’s, captors,
and with the silence of death had dragged the savage from his
pony, dispatched him and mounted the animal himself.</p>

<p>“What does the man mean?” mused Frank; “what next
will he do&mdash;Oh!”</p>

<p>The exclamation involuntarily escaped his lips, but it was
drowned in the noise of the animals’ feet. In passing under
some low, drooping boughs where the gloom was impenetrable
to the human eye, Frank felt a heavy form drop from the
limbs overhead <em>behind him on the animal he was riding</em>, and the
captive felt that his bonds were being cut.</p>

<p>“For heaben’s sake don’t breafe! it’s dis black nigger.”</p>

<p>Frank recognized the voice as that of Ebony Jim, and he
at once realized the situation of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Dar, take dat,” whispered the darky, placing a knife in
Frank’s hand, “and loosen your feet.”</p>

<p>Frank leaned over and cut the thongs. So far he was free.
A moment later there were heard the hasty footfalls of hurrying
feet.</p>

<p>The escape was not discovered for some moments, and then
a hurried but vain search was commenced by the Indians.
Frank was saved by as bold, silent and daring a stratagem as
was ever conceived by the fearless borderman.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Frank’s rifle, accouterments and coat were restored
to him, they having been in possession of the unfortunate
chief, whom the two hunters dragged from his pony unseen.
The rest of his things, including his share of the robbers’
gold, were lost.</p>

<p>Matters being explained all around, the three set off through
the forest in hopes of finding Walter.</p>

<p>They had not traveled far, when they discovered that they
were being followed, while in every direction they could hear
the hooting of owls, the cry of the night-hawk, and the sharp
barking of the wolf.</p>

<p>To Frank these sounds seemed natural enough, but to the
two hunters they did not, for they knew that they were the
signals of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Ay, now!” exclaimed O’Flynn, “and it’s a divil av a
time wees are going to have. The whole Cheyenne nation
is in these hills, so they are.”</p>

<p>“S’pose we strike fur de Bear’s Cave,” said Ebony Jim.</p>

<p>“Aghrade,” responded the Irishman, and so they shaped
their course accordingly.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the cavern in question was reached, and
taking the lead, Ebony Jim led the way into the black subterranean
passage.</p>

<p>They had not gone more than fifty feet when a glowing
fire, in a chamber to their right, burst suddenly upon their
eyes; and within the light of the fire they saw three men
seated, engaged in conversation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE ROBBERS’ RANCH.</span></h2>


<p>Solomon Strange felt a cold chill creep over him as
he seated himself in the robber captain’s private apartment,
which was furnished with all the elegance that heart could
wish and gold procure. An oil lamp was burning on a chintz-covered
stand, lighting up the room.</p>

<p>“You’ve a cozy lair here, Dungarvon,” said Strange, gazing
around, with apparent admiration.</p>

<p>“Yes, one into which I defy the lightning’s bolt to enter,”
returned the captain, as he crossed the room, and took from
an alcove in the wall a bottle of brandy and a couple of silver
goblets, which he placed upon the table. “But come, Black
Bear, wheel your chair up to the table and let’s drink to <em>our</em>
success.”</p>

<p>Strange could not deny the robber chief’s request, for he
was then an honored guest in his house, so he moved his chair
to the table and filled the goblets with the brandy. Then with
one hand he parted the hairy mask from his lips, and with
the other he lifted the goblet, and with a “Here’s to you,
captain,” dashed off the fiery liquid at a draught.</p>

<p>After several glasses had been drank, Dungarvon seized
a rope communicating with some other room and jerked it
violently. Strange heard the faint tinkle of a bell, and a moment
after the wall on the side opposite from that through
which they had entered, rolled apart, and a slim, pale youth
of some twenty years entered.</p>

<p>“Roderick,” said the captain, addressing the youth, “bring
me and the great chief, Black Bear, some supper at once.”</p>

<p>The youth turned and left the room, the walls closing after
him.</p>

<p>“That’s our cook,” said the chief-robber.</p>

<p>Presently Roderick returned with a well-prepared lunch,
which the robber-captain and his guest ate with a keen
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>After the meal had been dispatched, Dungarvon said:</p>

<p>“Now we are ready for business, Brandon; but excuse me
for a moment,” and he passed out through the opening
through which Roderick had come and went.</p>

<p>“Well, that beats me,” muttered Strange, when he found
himself alone; “the idea of these rocky walls parting at the
touch of their inmates. Wonder if they will part at <em>my</em>
touch?” and rising, he advanced to the wall through which
they had entered the room, and touched the little projecting
rock that he had seen Duval touch when they entered, expecting
to see the walls roll back. But he was disappointed;
they remained immovable as the rock of ages, and after several
fruitless efforts to possess himself of the secret, he took
his seat.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Dungarvon entered the room, followed
by a score of his men, rough, burly-looking fellows, whose
waists were girded with knives and pistols.</p>

<p>Dungarvon introduced his men to the supposed Black Bear,
then said:</p>

<p>“Well, Brandon, we’re ready.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” returned Strange.</p>

<p>“Then advance through that opening into the adjoining
chamber nine paces and stop,” said the chief.</p>

<p>Strange advanced into the chamber, which was black as
Hades, and which, from the hollow, sepulchral echo of his
footfalls, he knew was large and capacious. Had it been the
real Blufe Brandon, his cowardly heart would have shrunk
with terror, knowing what was coming.</p>

<p>Through the dark nine paces, Solomon Strange groped his
way, then stopped. At that instant the room was suddenly
lit up by a glowing light from behind. And, horrors!</p>

<p>He stood on one side of a long table, while facing him on
the other side, sat, bolt upright, in arm-chairs, with black
cloaks thrown over their shoulders, a dozen human skeletons
glaring at him in a ghastly, horrifying manner. Each one
clutched in its bony hand, which protruded from under the
cloak, a small glittering dagger. On the table in front of
each one sat a small glass goblet filled with some red liquid
resembling blood. Not a living soul was to be seen in the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>Although the mysterious Solomon Strange had expected to
see the same, as Dungarvon had told him, he felt an inward
shudder of horror and disgust, and had he not been playing
a desperate and secret game, he would have turned away and
cursed the robbers for their fiendishness in thus tampering
with the remains of the dead. But such an act would have
exposed him, and he resolved to go on with the play he had
successfully begun.</p>

<p>The instant the light had flashed upon the ghastly figures
before him, the one in the center arose to a standing posture,
as though possessed of life. The grinning mouth was opened,
and then these words seemed to fall from its lips, hollow
and sepulchral:</p>

<p>“Bluford Brandon, are you aware of what you have done? do
you know that you have entered the brotherhood of Mountain
Men? If you do, beware!” and the figure raised its bony hand
in which it clutched the glittering dagger as if to strike, then
it fell at its side again. Then each of the other ghastly figures
raised their glittering daggers, and as they dropped again, they
seemed to repeat, in one voice:</p>

<p>“Beware!”</p>

<p>The standing figure then went on:</p>

<p>“Look at these glasses, Bluford Brandon; they contain
the blood of those who once were Mountain Men&mdash;the blood
of those who stand before you, those who were once as you
now are; but we were traitors; we essayed to betray our
brothers into the hands of the Government detectives; but,
ah! the vengeance of the brotherhood fell upon us, and
sapped our life-blood out, and left us what you see us&mdash;a
<em>ghastly warning to others</em>! And now again I say, beware!”</p>

<p>“Beware!” chattered the other figures.</p>

<p>At this instant the room was wrapped in blinding darkness.
Then Strange distinguished the light footfalls of hurrying
feet. He heard the robbers removing the ghastly figures, and
the ventriloquist that had put the words of life in their mouths,
scrambling from <em>under the table</em>, where he had been concealed
with others of the robbers, who, with wire connections, had
raised the arms of the skeletons.</p>

<p>Presently all became silent, then the light flashed through
the chamber again, and in the chairs where the skeleton had<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
sat, Solomon Strange saw a number of robbers seated, while,
where the figure stood, Duval Dungarvon was standing.</p>

<p>Instead of daggers, the robbers held in their hands the
goblets of (not blood) red, sparkling wine, which as they lifted
to their lips, Dungarvon said:</p>

<p>“Here’s to Black Bear, the great Cheyenne chief, our new and
distinguished member of the brotherhood of Mountain Men,”
and as he concluded, they placed the goblets to their lips and
drank.</p>

<p>And thus ended the ceremony, which, to the reader, may
be horrifying and even disgusting, nevertheless it is a positive
fact that such a custom did exist among the mountain robbers.</p>

<p>“Now, come, Black Bear,” said Dungarvon, taking that
supposed worthy by the skin-clad arm, “and I will show you
through our ranch, and the secrets connected with it.”</p>

<p>The two crossed the wide chamber, which Dungarvon had
designated the “Cloister of the Ghouls,” and entered a smaller
apartment that was brilliantly lighted. In this room was a
carpenter’s work-bench and tools of all kinds.</p>

<p>“This,” said Dungarvon, “is the mechanical department.
We often find it necessary to our success to use a carpenter to
make coffins and other things. But let us go on.”</p>

<p>They passed into another apartment.</p>

<p>“This is our engraving-room and mint, for making counterfeit
‘greenbacks’ and ‘gold coin.’ Now I will show you how
we make our doors open and close,” he said, leading Solomon
Strange, who was drinking in every word with the deepest
interest, back to his own apartment.</p>

<p>“You see this small projection; by <em>pushing</em> on it when the
door is open, it will close; and by <em>pulling</em> upon it, it will open
the door, thus,” and the robber-chief illustrated the matter, by
causing the wall to roll apart and then shut again. “Now,
the whole thing is worked by hidden springs, how exactly, no
one ever knew, but the inventor, who was three years in constructing
the doors in this cavern. First, however, immense
grooves were chiseled in the floor and ceiling, and in them,
these great rocks move on invisible rollers. All the machinery
that works it is concealed in an artificial cavity back in
the permanent walls. Now see, Brandon, if you can open
and shut the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>The supposed Brandon seized hold of the projection, and
pulled toward him. A thrill of joy passed through his frame,
as the heavy walls rolled apart. Then he pressed upon the
projection, and they closed again.</p>

<p>“Now I have one more apartment to show you, Blufe, and
that’s what we call ‘the Dead Fall,’ where old Barker and the
two Omaha ‘larks,’ are consigned.”</p>

<p>Procuring a lantern, the robber-captain and his friend
passed out into the main entrance. This they followed some
distance until they came to where a wall, crossing the passage
at right angles, disputed their further entrance.</p>

<p>“This,” said Dungarvon, tapping the wall before them, “is
the door to the ‘Dead Fall.’ See here. By pressing a spring
in <em>this</em> niche, the door is <em>unlocked</em>, and by pressing another in
<em>this</em> niche, the door rolls back into a cavity in the wall and
the passage is continued. No one not acquainted with the
cavern would ever know but what the passage terminates
here. Shall we enter the Dead Fall?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” returned Strange: “by all means. I should
like to see the man that was thrown into a fifty-foot shaft and
climbed out alive.”</p>

<p>The robber-captain opened the door and they advanced
into the great chamber, wherein Willis and Ralph had been
entrapped, and where they were now imprisoned with Barker.</p>

<p>Closing the door after them, they advanced to where the
prisoners lay upon a couch of old skins. They all arose to a
sitting posture when they heard the two men entering.</p>

<p>Willis and Ralph looked sad and dejected, but Barker:
God of mercy! he resembled a skeleton more than a human.
He was wasted away to a mere shadow, while long beard and
hair of snowy whiteness hung down upon his breast and
shoulders. His hands were like the claws of an eagle, and
great, pitiful eyes stared at the robber-chief with a wild expression.</p>

<p>“Well, my larks, how are you getting along?” asked Dungarvon,
with a demoniac leer.</p>

<p>“Oh, God! we are dying by inches,” returned Barker.</p>

<p>The robber-captain laughed mockingly, while Solomon
Strange turned away with tears of pity in his eyes.</p>

<p>In a moment more the robber-chief and his companion<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
left the Dead Fall. When they had got back into the captain’s
room, a fresh bottle of brandy was brought out and
placed upon the table.</p>

<p>Drawing the cork, the robber-chief passed the bottle over
to Strange, saying:</p>

<p>“Here, Brandon, take the golden nectar right from Black
Betty’s lips&mdash;no use foolin’ with goblets.”</p>

<p>Strange took up the bottle, and while the captain’s eyes
were turned, he managed to pour half the contents on the
floor under pretense of drinking, then passed the bottle back
to Dungarvon.</p>

<p>The captain took it, and holding it up between his eyes and
the light, exclaimed with a drunken leer:</p>

<p>“By Jove, Brandon, you <em>have</em> got a lip for glory, and now
I’ll show you that I can swamp the other half,” and so saying,
he turned the bottle to his lips and emptied it.</p>

<p>Strange chuckled to himself, as the captain staggered to a
chair, saying:</p>

<p>“S’pose you’re going to stay all night with me, Brandon,
are you (hic) not? My men are all in bed long (hic)
ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon, as we’re having a good time, I will stay.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Blufe, you’re (hic) a jolly dog of a boy. Just
look in the alcove (hic) and get another Black Betty.” But
before the bottle could be brought, the robber rolled upon the
floor like a dead man.</p>

<p>“Thank God! <em>my</em> time has come,” muttered Strange to
himself. And taking up the robber’s lantern he lit it. In
one corner of the room stood a number of rifles with powder-horns
and shot-pouches hung upon them. Strange selected
three of the finest-looking, one of which proved to be Willis
Armond’s repeating rifle, and taking them in his arms he
opened the outlet in the wall and passed out into the main
entrance. He then leaned the rifles against the wall, and
turning moved toward the Dead Fall.</p>

<p>In a moment he had reached the door, and pressing the
two springs it rolled back into the wall. He entered the room
and stood before the prisoners.</p>

<p>“Barker, Armond, Rodman, come,” he said, speaking hastily,
“come, if you wish to escape!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“And, in the name of God, who are you that speaks thus,”
gasped Willis, starting up at sound of the man’s voice; “are
you a beast, or are you a human in disguise?”</p>

<p>“I’m a friend. Let that suffice. Come, I say, come.”</p>

<p>Strange led the way and the three prisoners arose and followed
him, though the young men were compelled to assist
Barker.</p>

<p>In a moment they came to where Strange had left the
guns.</p>

<p>“Here are rifles and ammunition,” he said, handing each
of them a weapon, “and here is my hunting-knife. Now
wait here a moment.”</p>

<p>He opened the walls and passed into Dungarvon’s room,
and returned in a moment with a bottle of brandy.</p>

<p>“Here, boys, take this. It will strengthen you,” he said.
“At the door or mouth of the cavern is a sentinel. Should
he demand a password, say to him, ‘Golden.’ Should he recognize
you in the dark, knock him down and fly. One
word more. Barker, do you know where the Devil’s Tarn
is?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Barker.</p>

<p>“Meet me there to-morrow evening. Don’t fail. Go.”</p>

<p>The prisoners moved along the dark passage, wondering
who their strange deliverer could be. At the mouth of the
cavern they found the wary sentinel <em>sound asleep</em>, and passing
him, they plunged out into the <em>free air of heaven</em>.</p>

<p>Strange waited until they had had time to make their escape,
then he turned and moved back to the door of the Dead
Fall. He saw that it was fastened, then he placed his finger
into the niche and tore out the spring that unlocked it. His
work for the night was accomplished. The door to the Dead
Fall could never be opened until it was battered down with
sledges, and, consequently, the robbers would never know but
that the prisoners were still in there.</p>

<p>Softly Solomon Strange stole back into the robber-captain’s
room, and having put out the lantern, he stretched himself
upon the carpeted floor and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was daylight, though no ray of sunshine
ever shone in the cavern. Lamps furnished the only light
there. Dungarvon had slept off the effect of his night’s carouse,<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
and when his guest awoke he found him seated by the
table reading a paper that one of his spies had brought in
from Cheyenne City during the night.</p>

<p>Breakfast was brought in to the captain and his guest, the
other robbers dining in the Cloister of the Ghouls.</p>

<p>After their morning repast was over, the false Black Bear
took his departure for the Indian encampment, having expressed
a hope that when he came back to the ranch he
would have Silvia Sanford to hand over to the robber-captain.</p>

<p>Briskly through the forest and over the stony hills went
the mysterious Solomon Strange.</p>

<p>Keeping to the right of the Indian encampment he struck
the little glade wherein, but two nights ago, he had slain the
renegade chief, Blufe Brandon, and entered a small cavern
near at hand.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed by, then he appeared again. But he
was not in the disguise of the Black Bear. He wore his own
ragged garments and carried his heavy, knotted club. For a
moment he stood and gazed around him, then he strode away
toward the west, his long yellow hair and whiskers streaming
in the wind.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when his ears caught the sound of
clattering hoofs. He looked down the path before him
and saw Rodger Rainbolt, the ranger, coming toward him.</p>

<p>Stopping, he placed one foot in advance of the other,
seized his club in both hands, and swinging it aloft, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Stop! stop! stop, my lord, or I’ll beat you, beat you
down!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A CHIEF’S DEATH</span></h2>


<p>It required but a single glance for Frank Armond to recognize
two of the three men seated around the glowing fire
in the cavern, called by the two hunters Bear’s Cave. They
were Ralph Rodman and his brother Willis. The third person,
the reader will readily guess, was Gustave Barker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>A shout of joy escaped Frank’s lips when he saw his friend
and brother were safe.</p>

<p>In a moment they were grouped around the fire, greeting
each other as though they had been separated for years.</p>

<p>“But where is Walter?” asked Willis.</p>

<p>“The good Lord only knows,” responded Frank; “he became
separated from me to-day while being pursued by a band
of Indians. I hope, however, he is safe.”</p>

<p>“And, now, jis’ tell dis chile how ye ’scape from de robbers’
den,” said Ebony.</p>

<p>“Well, we escaped to-night, by the assistance of a man
disguised in a bear’s skin, and whom the robber-captain called
Black Bear,” returned Willis; then turning to Barker, he continued:
“This Mr. Barker escaped with us. He had been a
prisoner there for three years. He knew uncle Wayland Sanford,
Frank, years ago in California.”</p>

<p>“I am happy to meet the friend of my dear old uncle,”
said Frank, grasping the thin, cold hand of Barker, “but of
course, Willis has told you of uncle Wayland’s sudden and
mysterious death.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my young friend, and I would have given my life to
have seen your uncle before his death,” returned Barker.</p>

<p>“You must have cherished a great affection for him, Mr.
Barker.”</p>

<p>“Not only that, young man, but I hold a secret that would
have prolonged his life twenty years.”</p>

<p>Barker began and related the story of Wayland Sanford
being convicted of murder at Miner’s Gulch on the Yuba,
through the instrumentality of Duval Dungarvon, as the reader
has already heard it from the lips of Dungarvon himself.
Then he told how he had hid bleeding and mangled in the
shaft for five days before he was taken out, more dead than
alive, to find both Sanford and Dungarvon gone. Then he
told how he had labored in the mines, accumulated a large
fortune, started to his home in the East, was robbed of his
gold in the mountains, and left for dead a second time; how
he recovered and hid away in the mountains, where for years
he remained a hunter, and finally fell into the hands of his
would-be murderer, Duval Dungarvon, and that he had never
heard of Wayland Sanford until he met Willis in prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>“Then you are acquainted with these Black Hills?” said
Frank, when Barker had finished his story.</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew every hill, hollow, and stream, and about
two months before my incarceration in the robbers’ den, I had
met and become acquainted with a young ranger in whom I
took a deep interest, and whom I would love to see.”</p>

<p>“Did you make him a present of something once?” asked
Frank, as a thought occurred to his mind.</p>

<p>“Yes; a trained, pet eagle. Have you met Rodger Rainbolt?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was he who dealt&mdash;” began Frank, but at this
juncture Flick O’Flynn appeared from the entrance and interrupted
him, saying:</p>

<p>“Ay, b’ys, and it’s a divil av a time we’re going to have.
The red divils have found out our hiding-sphot, and th’y’re
swharming like hornits arhound us on the outside. Musha!
it’s fite ’r stharve, so bring yer tools, b’ys, and come to the
front.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this cavern called Bear’s Cave?” suddenly asked
Barker, as they started to their feet in alarm.</p>

<p>“Indade it is,” responded O’Flynn.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” exclaimed Barker, “I had forgotten
the place. Do you know that there are <em>two</em> entrances to it?”</p>

<p>“Ho’y mother, no!” responded Flick.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the passage behind them. They glanced
back. A cry of horror escaped each lip, for with a
flaming torch in one hand and a tomahawk in the other, they
beheld a score of savages, led by the young chief Allacotah,
advancing toward them.</p>

<p>Quick as thought Frank and Willis raised their repeating
rifles and fired. Allacotah fell dead, with a bullet through
his heart. Again and again the young men fired until every
chamber of their rifles was empty. A savage fell at every
shot. The others recoiled, then when the war-whoop of another
party coming in at the entrance rolled through the
cavern, they rallied and closed in upon our friends.</p>

<p>The conflict was short. Our friends were all, save one,
overpowered and made prisoners. Gustave Barker, like the
phantom that he seemed, had glided from the cavern and
made his escape in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>And now a wail of lamentation echoed through the cavern,
as the savages gathered around the lifeless form of their young
chief Allacotah. Victory had been dearly bought by them.
Besides their chief, a dozen of the best warriors lay dead,
while not one of their enemies had fallen. Though it would
have been an easy matter to have tomahawked the captives,
they dare not, for the great chief, Black Bear, had ordered
that all captives be taken and brought to the village alive
and unharmed.</p>

<p>Litters were constructed of blankets, and the dead and
wounded placed upon them to be taken back to the village.</p>

<p>The prisoners’ feet were unbound and they permitted to
stand; and then with their hands bound at their backs, they
were marched out the cavern.</p>

<p>The first glimmer of approaching day was beginning to
streak the eastern sky.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the dead had been brought from the
cavern, and then the party filed away through the forest in
the direction of the Indian village.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">RAINBOLT MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT.</span></h2>


<p>Rainbolt halted before the mysterious Solomon Strange,
a smile resting upon his features, a feeling of strange curiosity
upon his mind.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” laughed Strange, “so we have met again, my
lord Oliver&mdash;I mean, Thunderbolt.”</p>

<p>“So it seems, though you were the last person I had expected
to meet, Mr. Strange,” replied the ranger.</p>

<p>“And why so&mdash;why so, my lord?”</p>

<p>“I supposed you were on the Pacific coast with old Neptune.”</p>

<p>“So I have been, my lord, and a right merry time had old
Nep. and I.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought you would have remained there,
Mr. Strange, with your old friend of the sea,” said Rainbolt,
scarcely knowing what to make of the wild, strange man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“I would have remained, my lord, but in making my passage
over these hills when I saw you before, I heard a dark secret
connected with them, and that an awful demon rode on the
midnight air over the mountain, striking terror to every heart,
every heart, my lord.”</p>

<p>“And who told you so much, Mr. Strange?”</p>

<p>“The wind, the wind, my lord. And the secret I’ll fathom
and the demon I’ll slay. And now, is there aught of the
past or future you would wish to know, my lord?”</p>

<p>“There is much I would like to know, Mr. Strange,” returned
the ranger, “but I can scarcely remember any thing,
now.”</p>

<p>“You doubt me, my lord, but hearken: <em>Your wife lives</em>,
my lord, and seek you not another! Ay, you start, but it is
so. And let me tell you more, my lord. Since God in his
mercy saved you from <em>death at the falls</em>, you need have no fear
of your fellow-men. Your shoulders bear the weight of no
crime; you were the victim of a foul plot&mdash;the letter was
forged by one Duval Dungarvon in hopes of having you hung,
hung, my lord.”</p>

<p>As the strange man concluded, he turned and strode briskly
away, leaving the ranger seated alone upon his animal, completely
dumbfounded and mystified.</p>

<p>“Who is he? Who is he?” muttered the ranger to himself;
“he is a queer, strange creature, one that knows all
about my past, and can even read my thoughts. Heavens!
what if it is&mdash;no, it can’t be, but I will overtake him and make
further inquiries.”</p>

<p>Rainbolt spoke to his animal and dashed away in pursuit
of Solomon Strange, but he had gone but a short distance,
when a lithe figure glided suddenly across his path, frightened
his animal, causing it to rear and plunge wildly and throw
its rider to the ground, and unfortunately, in the fall, the
ranger’s head struck upon a sharp rock, completely stunning
him.</p>

<p>As the unfortunate man lay thus unconscious, the figure that
had frightened his animal glided from the undergrowth and
bent over his prostrate form. It was the Indian woman, Silver
Voice.</p>

<p>As she gazed down into the ranger’s face, a low, convulsive<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
sob burst from her lips, and then she stooped and kissed his
pale lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” she sobbed, “have I killed him? Oh,
Warren, my love, my darling! Let me hear you say that you
forgive. I did not intend to scare your pony. Oh, Warren!
Warren! my wronged and forsaken husband, are you dead at
last? But perhaps it is better that you never lived to die with
shame for her you loved.”</p>

<p>“Florence.”</p>

<p>Silver Voice started up. It was the ranger’s lips that articulated
the name. The voice of the woman seemed to recall
him back to consciousness. He opened his eyes, gazed around
him and up into the face of the woman bending over him.
He recognized the face beneath its dusky paint, and springing
up like one delirious, he clasped the form of the woman in his
arms and pressed her to his breast.</p>

<p>“Florence, my wife,” he cried, “have I found you, whom
the world thinks dead?”</p>

<p>She tried to free herself from his embrace, saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, you have found me, Warren, but in disgrace and
disguise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God! Florence, my darling wife, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I am no longer worthy of your love. It will
only wound your heart deeper to tell you. Go, and forget
me,” and she turned to leave, but the ranger detained her.</p>

<p>“Stay, Florence, do not leave me. You are mine. Mine
to love, and mine to cherish. Why do you turn from me?”</p>

<p>“Because I am no longer worthy of your love, but God
knows I supposed you dead.”</p>

<p>“Florence, my wife, I can guess your secret. You are the
wife of an Indian.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God! it is but too true, Warren; for two years I
have been the wife of Allacotah&mdash;a noble and kind young
chief, in whose veins course Anglo-Saxon blood by nature, if
not by birth.”</p>

<p>The ranger groaned aloud, as though his heart was bursting.</p>

<p>“Then you love your Indian husband, Florence?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<p>“No, I only admired him for his kindness and noble principles,
such as no other Indian ever possessed. I became his
wife, only for protection from the insults of <em>his</em> people and
the power of <em>my</em> people. But, I supposed you dead, Warren.
Your servant told me he had seen you dashed to pieces over
the Devil’s Tarn. Never, until the night you rescued Silvia
from Black Bear, did I know you lived. And now you know
my secret, my disgrace, Warren; so let me go.”</p>

<p>“No, Florence, you are mine. What you have done makes
me love you all the stronger. It is no disgrace, it is only
what a strong, brave and sensible woman would, and should
have done under such trying circumstances.”</p>

<p>“But, Warren, you love another&mdash;you love my sister, Silvia.”</p>

<p>“Only because she <em>is</em> your sister. God knows I never
<em>could</em> love another as I do you, my angel, Florence.”</p>

<p>Before Silver Voice could reply, Echo, the eagle, darted
down through the forest with his warning cry of danger.</p>

<p>Turning quickly around, the ranger and his wife&mdash;for such
she was, dear reader&mdash;saw a number of savages coming directly
toward them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Warren,” the woman cried, “they are savages! fly
for your life. They hate you&mdash;they will kill you!”</p>

<p>“Life is nothing more to me, Florence, without you,” replied
the ranger, calmly.</p>

<p>“Then fly, Warren, for my sake.”</p>

<p>The ranger stooped and kissed the sweet, pleading lips of
his wife, and with a feeling of joy that had long been a stranger
to his heart, he turned, and catching his animal that was
grazing near, sprung into the saddle and dashed sharply away.</p>

<p>He at once shaped his course for his cavern home, which
he reached after two hours’ brisk riding.</p>

<p>On entering Silvia’s apartment, what was his surprise to
find a young man seated therein with her! As he entered,
Silvia and the stranger arose to their feet, when the maiden
said:</p>

<p>“My friend, Mr. Walter Lyman, Mr. Rainbolt.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">STARTLING NEWS.</span></h2>


<p>The ranger grasped young Lyman by the hand, and gazing
into his eyes reflectively, said:</p>

<p>“I am sure we have met before, Mr. Lyman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; on the night you rescued Colonel Wayland Sanford
and his party from the Indians,” returned Lyman.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember you now; but where are the rest
of your party?”</p>

<p>“I know where none of them are but Colonel Sanford.
Yesterday I became separated from my friends, and in wandering
by the falls to-day I met Miss Sanford, who invited
me into your hidden home.”</p>

<p>“You’re a thousand times welcome, Mr. Lyman. But you
said you knew where Mr. Sanford was, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he is dead,” the young man returned, seriously.</p>

<p>“Dead!” exclaimed the ranger, starting up and glancing at
Silvia, who was weeping tears of sorrow. “Wayland Sanford
<em>dead</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he fell dead with the heart disease a few moments
after you left that night. He was buried in the glade where
he died.”</p>

<p>The ranger dropped into a chair. A silence that was broken
only by Silvia’s sobs fell upon the place. Young Lyman
watched the ranger’s face with deep interest, and saw that he
was terribly agitated.</p>

<p>Presently Silvia raised her head from the table and asked:</p>

<p>“Mr. Rainbolt, what was written upon that paper which
you gave father the night you met him?”</p>

<p>The ranger was much surprised by the question, but replied:</p>

<p>“I wrote that Rodger Rainbolt and Warren Walraven were
one and the same person.”</p>

<p>“Then your name is not Rodger Rainbolt?” asked Silvia.</p>

<p>“No; my name is Warren Walraven.”</p>

<p>“And did you know my father? and did he know you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; why shouldn’t he, when his daughter Florence, your
sister, Silvia, is <em>my wife</em>?”</p>

<p>“Rodger, you are jesting!” Silvia exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I am not, Silvia; I have long thought I would tell you
this.”</p>

<p>“But we never knew that Florence was married before she
died, or drowned herself.”</p>

<p>“No, Silvia, we were married secretly. You were in Omaha
at the time, so I never saw you until the night I rescued
you from Black Bear,” said the ranger; “and let me tell you
something else that will surprise you: Florence is <em>not</em> dead!”</p>

<p>“Rodger!” Silvia gasped; “is that true?”</p>

<p>“It is, Silvia; the woman in Indian disguise known as Silver
Voice, is Florence.”</p>

<p>“Rodger, it is impossible! Silver Voice is the wife of an
Indian chief.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Silvia, but for all that she is Florence,” said the ranger,
and he went on and related the cause of Florence’s flight
to the Indian country, and her marriage to Allacotah, as Florence
had related it to him.</p>

<p>“Then Florence did not commit a willful wrong in marrying
the chief. But why did you not make your existence
known to her before she fled?”</p>

<p>In reply to this, the ranger related the story of his trials
and sufferings, of which the reader is already aware.</p>

<p>He stated that when he went over the falls in the canoe,
the little craft alighted upon its end in such a way as not to
injure him severely; and that, by some chance, it was thrown
backward <em>under</em> the falls instead of outward. Here he discovered
the cavern that he had made his home.</p>

<p>“And where is Florence now?” asked Silvia.</p>

<p>“I left her in the forest near the Indian encampment. She
begged me to fly, to escape a band of Indians we saw approaching.
I did so, but since you have company, and it is some
time until night, I will go in search of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do, Rodger, and bring her here!” cried Silvia.</p>

<p>The ranger turned to leave the room, saying:</p>

<p>“I will go and try, but I fear I can never induce her to
leave the Indians.”</p>

<p>Before Silvia could reply he was gone.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE INTERVIEW.</span></h2>


<p>It is a night of fearful storm, but one that has been full of
events to the captives. Taken to the Indian village they
were doomed to the stake; but the counterfeit Black Bear
coming in with Florence, had learned all&mdash;the assault on the
cave, the death of Allacotah, which freed the unhappy wife
from a bond that must have broken her heart&mdash;and by co-operating
with Rainbolt, whom Florence brought to the guidance
of the released captives, the brave Solomon Strange had,
under cover of the storm, set the whole party free; and we
now behold them gathered in the Ranger’s Cave, happy
enough over their release. But the happiest of all was the
ranger himself, who, with his restored wife in his arms, was
repaid for his long, long days of suffering.</p>

<p>Only Solomon Strange was abroad on that night. Furiously
the wind drove in his face as he moved westward
through the woods, guided by the lightning’s glare. But,
what cared the mysterious Solomon Strange for the bellowing
thunder, the rumbling wind, the sullen roar of the trees, the
crashing of fallen timber, the vivid lightning and the rain?
Ah, <em>what</em> cared he?</p>

<p>On through the forest aisles he went. On, on.</p>

<p>Presently he entered a small opening in the woods and
stopped.</p>

<p>That spot seemed to recall a dark deed to his mind, for it
was there that he had beaten down the renegade, Blufe
Brandon; and but a little ways off he could hear the waters
rushing wildly through the black gorge into which he had
thrown the body.</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause he crossed the glade and entered
the forest. A few steps more and he had disappeared in
the cavern, wherein that day he had left his bear-skin disguise.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and then he came forth again, but he
wore not the disguise of the Black Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>His long yellow hair and whiskers floated around his head
and face like ragged streamers in the wild winds.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the cavern he paused and leaned upon his
knotted club.</p>

<p>Just then a vivid flash of lightning revealed the figure of
a man with a thin, ghastly face and hollow eyes standing
before him.</p>

<p>He stepped back and raised his club, for sure was he that
an apparition confronted him.</p>

<p>Another flash of lightning. The figure still is there. Solomon
Strange started like a guilty thing, as he recognized the
man’s features&mdash;the features of the renegade, Blufe Brandon.</p>

<p>“Brandon, is it you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; who are you?” returned the supposed defunct renegade.</p>

<p>“I am Solomon Strange, the Wizard of the West, the same
who beat you down in the forest glade, and tumbled you into
the gorge for dead. Ho! ho! a right merry time have I
had playing Black Bear. Your bear-skin fit me to a gnat’s
heel, Mr. Blufe, and then I went up to the robbers’ ranch
and passed myself off as Black Bear, and was initiated in the
brotherhood of Mountain Men, as you had arranged at the
Devil’s Tarn. Oh, a right jolly time had Duval Dungarvon
and I, Mr. Blufe. A gay dog is Captain Duval, but he got
drunk and I didn’t, and the reason was, he poured goblets of
liquor down his throat, while I poured just as much down&mdash;upon
the floor. And while Duval, the thirsty dog, lay
dead drunk, I stole a bottle of his best, gave it to his prisoners,
and then let them out, locked the empty prison and hid
the key, Mr. Blufe. And all this merry sport I’ve had in
your bear-skin, and no one knew but I was Black Bear himself.
But, how glad I am that you are not dead, Mr. Blufe,
for I felt like I had done a dirty little deed when I flung you
into the gorge, so deep, so dark, Mr. Blufe.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are an infernal fool,” returned the bruised
and wounded renegade, growing enraged at what he knew
must be so.</p>

<p>“Whew! how the winds blow,” continued Strange.
“Come into the cavern and I will tell you more, Mr. Blufe.<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
Come in where the rain won’t wash you into the gorge, for
there is only a shadow of you left, you unfortunate dog.”</p>

<p>“Go to the devil,” responded the renegade; “I will not go
in.”</p>

<p>“But, you must come, you must hear me, Mr. Blufe,” and
Strange seized him, and dragging him into the cavern, compelled
him to listen to an hour’s tales and talk.</p>

<p>When he had finished, however, he turned and glided out
the cavern into the forest.</p>

<p>Soon after Blufe Brandon, weak with loss of blood and
fasting, emerged from the cave and moved slowly away toward
the Indian encampment, cursing the mysterious author
of his sore bones and bruised head.</p>

<p>An hour after his interview with the resurrected chief,
Solomon Strange was seated under the shelter of a great pine
in conversation with another man, one whom he had requested
to meet him there&mdash;at the Devil’s Tarn.</p>

<p>That man was the white-haired prisoner of the robbers’
ranch, Gustave Barker.</p>

<p>For hours they sat and conversed as though no storm was
raging around them.</p>

<p>Finally the storm died away, and as the moon struggled
out through the rifts in the skurrying clouds, Solomon Strange
and his companion left their seat beneath the great pine by
the Devil’s Tarn, and took their way eastward through the
forest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DEMON NO MORE.</span></h2>


<p>Morning dawned bright and clear after the night of the
storm.</p>

<p>Our friends in the ranger’s cavern breakfasted early, for
they were anxious to be off for the land of civilization.</p>

<p>Captain Warren Walraven concluded to give up his wild, secluded
life, and with his angel wife go back to his old home
in Iowa.</p>

<p>Though Ebony Jim and Flick O’Flynn were going to accompany
them beyond the dangers of the hills, they had no<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
desire to quit their nomadic life of hunters, and, in token of
his respect for them, Rodger Rainbolt presented them his hidden
home and all its appurtenances, Purle, the pet panther,
and his library, though, unfortunately, neither of them could
read a word.</p>

<p>Echo, the eagle, the ranger resolved to keep, so long as a
feather of him was left.</p>

<p>As for Frank and Willis Armond, Ralph Rodman and
Walter Lyman, they were <em>fully</em> satisfied with their few days
of “recreation in the mountains,” and concluded to go back
to Omaha.</p>

<p>When all were ready to leave the cavern, Florence turned
to her husband and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Warren! how I would love to visit father’s lonely
grave before we return to the East.”</p>

<p>“And I, too,” said Silvia; “it would afford me great consolation
to look upon poor father’s grave before we go away.”</p>

<p>“Your desire shall be granted, my dear children,” said the
ranger, with tears of tenderness in his eyes.</p>

<p>And so they left the cavern.</p>

<p>The ranger called up his faithful mustang, and having
bridled and saddled it, mounted the women upon it.</p>

<p>Then, with the (seeming) indispensable and capacious saddle-bags,
which he always carried, thrown across his arm, the
ranger took the lead and the party moved away.</p>

<p>Echo, the eagle, had been sent away in advance to keep
his wary watch for danger before, while Ebony and Flick
were sent out on either side to watch out for any enemies
that might be disposed to attack them.</p>

<p>Their progress was slow and tedious, and it was not until
the end of the third day that they reached the little glade
wherein Wayland Sanford had been buried.</p>

<p>The young sportsmen found the grave as they had left it,
though the bodies of the savages were gone.</p>

<p>That night the party encamped in the glade by the grave.</p>

<p>After supper had been prepared and eaten, and while the
party sat around the camp-fire conversing, the subject of the
Aërial Demon came up.</p>

<p>After each one had given his opinions and views on the
subject, the ranger started to his feet, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I have been neglecting our safety. I will go out
into the forest and reconnoiter the immediate vicinity for
lurking danger, then we must station guards for the night,”
and as he concluded, he stooped and whispered something to
Florence and Silvia, then turned, and calling his eagle, that
had perched itself in a tree-top, walked away into the forest,
though none but the women noticed that he took his capacious
saddle-bags with him.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes he returned.</p>

<p>“Any signs ob danger, capt’ing?” asked Ebony.</p>

<p>“None whatever,” returned the captain; “but, where can
Echo be?” and, as he concluded, he placed the horn to his
lips and blew a blast that echoed far away through the hills.</p>

<p>In a moment a scream was heard down the valley, and all
eyes were instantly turned that way.</p>

<p>An exclamation of horror burst from the lips of the two
hunters and the four young sportsmen.</p>

<p>They saw the Aërial Demon coming up the valley toward
them!</p>

<p>The women uttered a little scream, while Rainbolt burst
into a hearty laugh, then he placed the horn to his lips and
blew another blast.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Aërial Demon was directly over the
camp, and as the blast of the horn pealed out, the horrid creature
ceased its flight and settled down, <em>down into the very midst
of the excited group</em>.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise, followed by a ringing laugh, pealed from
every lip.</p>

<p>The mystery of the Aërial Demon was explained, and the
two hunters and four young sportsmen felt no little ashamed
of their fears of such a harmless, but after all, a rather mysterious
contrivance of Rodger Rainbolt.</p>

<p>Let us analyze the Aërial Demon, the terror of the Indians:</p>

<p>First, it received its motive power of Echo, the eagle.</p>

<p>Second, its great arms, that beat and buffeted the air, were
the eagle’s wings, and the screams that it uttered were Echo’s
screams.</p>

<p>Third, the head of the demon was simply a dark lantern,
light and dextrously made, and carefully fastened upon Echo’s
back between the wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Fourth, the ghastly proportions, revealed by the flame, resembling
a human frame, <em>was the representation of a skeleton</em>,
made of light, dry pine, and suspended beneath the eagle by
means of a small strap attached to it and passing over the
back of the bird.</p>

<p>And this was the mystery of the Aërial Demon, a clever
and ingenious contrivance, which, on more than one occasion,
had saved the life of its originator! Only the patience of
Rodger Rainbolt, in training Echo to perform those aërial
missions, with almost a human understanding, could have produced
such a result.</p>

<p>The capacious saddle-bags he always carried, were the repository
of the rude contrivance.</p>

<p>Ebony was, at last, forced to give up the idea that the Aërial
Demon was the Old Nick, and begged hard for the eagle and
the demon that he might use it to work on the fears of the
Indians.</p>

<p>The ranger would not part with his noble bird, but gave
the lantern and fixtures to the darky, who declared he
would catch and train a hawk, or an owl, at the earliest time
possible.</p>

<p>And so the night was spent as well as circumstances would
admit, with our friends.</p>

<p>Morning dawned clear and warm.</p>

<p>The party breakfasted upon wild pigeon and venison procured
by the two hunters, and prepared by Florence.</p>

<p>When they were ready to resume their Journey, Florence
drew her husband toward her father’s grave, and said:</p>

<p>“Warren, promise me by this grave that you will forgive
my father the wrongs he has done you.”</p>

<p>“Let <em>that</em>,” he said, kissing her pleading lips, “be the seal
to the promise which I grant with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! by the mysteries of the Aërial Demon!
Here am I in the camp of a party of lords and ladies!”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the speaker. It was the mysterious
Solomon Strange, who had appeared from the forest at
this juncture, and halted in their midst.</p>

<p>Florence and Silvia changed significant smiles.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Mr. Strange,” said Captain Walraven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>“And I, you, my lord, but you all seem as serious as though
you were in a graveyard reading the inscriptions on the gravestones.”</p>

<p>“Sir, those ladies’ father lies buried there,” said Frank, pointing
to the grave.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” laughed Strange; “and how know you that,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“Because I helped to bury him there,” returned Frank.</p>

<p>“And what would you think, boy, if I, Solomon Strange,
gifted with the power of the ancient soothsayers, should tell
you that you are guilty of burying a <em>live man there</em>?”</p>

<p>“I would think you were a fool,” retorted Frank.</p>

<p>“‘To err is human, to forgive divine,’ but I will prove it to
you, my boy,” said Strange; and, as he concluded, began to
unfasten the strips of bark and twisted grass from his
limbs.</p>

<p>This done, his ragged garments dropped from his body, revealing
it dressed in a fashionable suit of dark cloth. Then
the man placed his hands to his head and face, and tore off
the wig and mask of long yellow hair and whiskers, and&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Colonel Wayland Sanford stood before them in perfect health!</em></p>

<p>The young sportsmen, the two hunters and Rodger Rainbolt
were completely dumbfounded, and started back as if
from a ghost, unable to utter a word.</p>

<p>A merry peal of laughter rung from the sisters’ lips. They
knew their father lived, and were prepared for the meeting.
He had made known his existence to Florence in the Indian
encampment, hence their private interviews there. Florence
then communicated the fact to Silvia.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed the colonel; “do you believe now,
my boy, that you buried a live man, <em>there</em>?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Wayland Sanford!” exclaimed Frank, realizing
the startling fact, “how in the name of Heaven did you
escape?”</p>

<p>“Easy enough, since you had buried me in a <em>state of catalepsy</em>,
brought on by excitement and fatigue, and not very deep in
the ground, for when I regained consciousness I found I was
in the ground, the dirt mostly off of me and a pack of wolves
lowering around. The beasts had dug the dirt away.”</p>

<p>The young men came forward and congratulated the colonel<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
on his resurrection and escape. Rainbolt took him by the
hand and said:</p>

<p>“I am happy to meet you thus, Wayland Sanford; your
part has been well played. Solomon Strange <em>was</em> a strange
man, and the mystery connected with him stands revealed.”</p>

<p>“Warren Walraven,” returned the colonel, “it eases my
heart to hear you talk thus&mdash;I, who, so&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind, colonel, never mind. I know what you
would say. Let the past be forgotten,” said the ranger.</p>

<p>“So be it, thank God!” murmured the colonel.</p>

<p>At this moment Gustave Barker emerged from the woods
and joined the happy group.</p>

<p>Wayland Sanford’s labor had been doubly rewarded.</p>

<p>When he had returned to consciousness and found that he
had been buried for dead, that his young friends were gone,
he recalled his situation, the last he knew before he fell unconscious
from the shock the news Rainbolt had communicated
to him had given him, he arose from his shallow grave,
beat off the wolves that had, fortunately, dug him out; and
then he resolved upon disguising himself and going forth to
meet the ranger, and bring to justice the man who held him
in his power.</p>

<p>He knew full well that Duval Dungarvon was the direct
cause of Silvia’s abduction, and he determined to search him
out and compel him to acknowledge his innocence in the
Miner’s Gulch affair to the world.</p>

<p>Before leaving the grave, however, he filled it up, smoothed
it over and then covered it with the brush which he supposed
his friends left over it. His object in this was to surprise
them just as we have seen, should they ever return there.</p>

<p>Procuring his disguise, he set forth. What he accomplished
the reader has already seen.</p>

<p>After some delay, the party resumed its journey toward
Cheyenne City, increased in number by the colonel and his
old friend, Gustave Barker.</p>

<p>In the course of several days they arrived at the city.</p>

<p>There Ebony Jim and Flick O’Flynn bid them adieu and
returned to the mountains, where they still remain; but as the
Aërial Demon has never been heard of since Rodger Rainbolt
left there, it is supposed that Ebony “couldn’t make it work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>Silvia and her father were so overpowered with joy, that
they gave up their visit to California, and returned with their
friends to Omaha.</p>

<p>Captain Warren Walraven and his beautiful wife, Florence,
reside at Council Bluffs, Iowa; and as it is but a little ways
over to Omaha, they often go over to see Walter and Silvia
Lyman, who had plighted their love in the ranger’s cavern,
away among the Black Hills, and who became man and wife
shortly after their return home.</p>

<p>Willis, Frank and Ralph are still single, and often declare
that Walter got the best of the summer’s recreation.</p>

<p>Colonel Sanford and his friend, Barker, reside in Omaha.</p>

<p>A short time since, Walter and Silvia became the happy
parents of a bright-eyed boy-baby, and they call him Rodger
Rainbolt.</p>

<p>And so we leave them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p>Once more, dear reader, let us go back to the Devil’s
Tarn.</p>

<p>It is night, but the moon is flooding the hill, wood and
valley with its light.</p>

<p>Within its light, on the banks of a stream at the verge of the
roaring falls, a man is standing, ever and anon glancing impatiently
around him.</p>

<p>It is Duval Dungarvon, the robber-captain, and who is he
there to meet?</p>

<p>The bushes part near him and a man stands before him.</p>

<p>It is Blufe Brandon, the renegade, and he is to meet Duval
Dungarvon.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got along at last, have you?” asked Dungarvon,
as the chief approached him. “I received your message
and came at once to meet you, and here I’ve been waiting for
an hour; but have you any news from the girl?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Duval, that I wasn’t here at the appointed<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
hour, but the fact is, I’ve been scarcely able to walk for <em>several</em>
days; and the girl&mdash;well, I’ll tell you soon.”</p>

<p>“Why, Blufe, what ails you? your voice sounds like the
grave. <em>Several</em> days? why you were well enough the night
you became one of the brotherhood.”</p>

<p>“Dungarvon, you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>“Why so? what do you mean, Blufe?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say. The other night that we met here, a
man was concealed where he heard every word we said, and
when we parted, he followed me, beat me down, stripped off
my bear-skin and put it on himself, threw me into a gorge,
where I lay, more dead than alive, several days. The night
of the storm I recovered sufficient to get out of the gorge just as
a flood of water came sweeping down. I moved off toward my
village, and on the way I met the man who had beat me down,
robbed me of my disguise, and threw me into the gorge. He
seized me, dragged me into a cavern, and told me that he had
been passing himself off as Black Bear, with success, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” roared Dungarvon; “well, your Indians
must be a set of cursed fools, blind at that, to let a stranger
fool them in that manner.”</p>

<p>“Well, he <em>did</em>,” continued Brandon, “and he went up to
your ranch and was initiated into your band as Black Bear,
and now who’s the blind fools? ha! ha! ha! Duval Dungarvon
and <em>his</em> men!”</p>

<p>“Brandon, you’re lying as fast as you can talk.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, my gallant Duval; but hear me through.
The man said you met him at Lone Pine, told him all about
your ceremony, as he heard you promise to tell me; then he
said you told him all about your killing the miner on the
Yuba, swearing the deed onto Wayland Sanford; your throwing
Barker into the shaft; the escape of Sanford; the affair
about the girl, Florence; the death of one Captain Walraven;
and the capture of Barker, the hero of the Yuba shaft, and
two Omaha ‘larks,’ all of which were then in your prison at
your ranch. Then he said you got drunk, and that he stole
a bottle of your brandy and gave it to Barker and the Omaha
‘larks,’ let them out of prison, locked the cell, and hid the
key.”</p>

<p>“Blufe! Is what you are telling true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“True as gospel, captain.”</p>

<p>“And did the man tell you his name?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was Wayland Sanford.”</p>

<p>Duval Dungarvon growled with anger, cursed with rage,
stamped with fury.</p>

<p>Blufe Brandon laughed in his face. This so enraged the
robber-captain that he dealt the renegade a blow in the face
that sent him heels over head into the brush.</p>

<p>Brandon sprung up, and drawing a knife, rushed upon his
robber friend, wild with sudden rage.</p>

<p>The two grappled. Brandon was the larger, and could
have easily handled the robber, but he was still quite weak
from his affair with Solomon Strange, and their strength was
about matched.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” hissed the renegade, “your life shall pay for
that blow!”</p>

<p>To and fro the struggling men swayed. Their faces were
livid with rage. Thick and fast fell the deadly blows. The
ground at their feet grew slippery with their own blood. At
last they fell, striking and tugging like maddened beasts. They
arose again to their feet, staggered backward and&mdash;</p>

<p>Toppling, fell over the cliff and were crushed to atoms, almost,
against the jagged rocks as they dropped in the stream
at the foot of the Devil’s Tarn.</p>

<p>Two figures came from the shadow of the woods, and walking
to the edge of the cliff, looked down into the foam-lashed
waters below.</p>

<p>“Golly, de jig’s up wid dem villains.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and their blood is not on our heads, so it ain’t.”</p>

<p>And Flick O’Flynn and Ebony Jim descended the cliff, entered
their canoe, and in a moment were lost in the mist and
spray at the foot of the Devil’s Tarn, as they sought their
cavern retreat.</p>

<p class="adcaption1">HAND-BOOK OF CROQUET.</p>

<p>A Complete Guide to the Principles and Practice of the Game. This popular
pastime has, during the few years of its existence, rapidly outgrown the first vague
and imperfect rules and regulations of its inventor; and, as almost every house at
which it is played adopts a different code of laws, it becomes a difficult matter for
a stranger to assimilate his play to that of other people. It is, therefore, highly
desirable that one uniform system should be generally adopted, and hence the object
of this work is to establish a recognized method of playing the game.</p>

<p class="adcaption1">DIME BOOK OF 100 GAMES.</p>

<p>Out-door and in-door SUMMER GAMES for Tourists and Families in the Country,

<p class="adcaption1">HAND-BOOK OF PEDESTRIANISM.</p>

<p>Giving the Rules for Training and Practice in Walking, Running, Leaping,
Vaulting, etc. Edited by Henry Chadwick.</p>

<p class="adcaption1">YACHTING AND ROWING.</p>

<p>This volume will be found very complete as a guide to the conduct of watercraft,
and full of interesting information alike to the amateur and the novice. The chapter
referring to the great rowing-match of the Oxford and Cambridge clubs on the
Thames, will be found particularly interesting.</p>

<p class="adcaption1">RIDING AND DRIVING.</p>

<p>A sure guide to correct Horsemanship, with complete directions for the road and
field; and a specific section of directions and information for female equestrians.
Drawn largely from “Stonehenge’s” fine manual, this volume will be found all
that can be desired by those seeking to know all about the horse, and his management
in harness and under the saddle.</p>

<p class="adcaption1">GUIDE TO SWIMMING.</p>

<p>Comprising Advisory Instructions; Rules upon Entering the Water; General
Directions for Swimming; Diving: How to Come to the Surface; Swimming on
the Back: How to Swim in times of Danger; Surf-bathing&mdash;How to Manage the
Waves, the Tides, etc.; a Chapter for the Ladies; a Specimen Female Swimming

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
